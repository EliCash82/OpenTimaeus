# OpenTimaeus

## Developed by Anderson Evans
## All artwork by Anderson Evans
## Timaeus by Plato

**OpenTimaeus** is constructed with RenJS which is built with Phaser.  This entry is being submitted to the Game Off 2018 which has the theme HYBRID.

`hyÂ·brid`: *the offspring of two plants or animals of different species or varieties.*

**OpenTimaeus** is the edutainment offering *Apple* and *Nintendo* could have given us if they'd teamed up in the days before monitors had color.  It's part *monochrome era visual novel*, part *Socratic dialogue*... you have come upon the full text of Plato's Timaeus, except with the look and feel of a budget cutscene from 1989 appearing just between the first boss fight and Level 2.
