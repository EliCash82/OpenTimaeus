  - socrates says: And in assigning on natural principles but one

  - socrates says: we declared that those whose duty it was to fight on behalf of
  - socrates says: the community must be guardians only of the city, in case any
  - socrates says: one whether without or within her walls should seek to injure
  - socrates says: her, and that they should give judgment mercifully to their

  - socrates says: And those who had undergone this discipline, we
  - socrates says: said, must not consider that they have any private property in
  - socrates says: gold or silver or anything else whatsoever, but as auxiliaries
  - socrates says: drawing from those whom they preserved so much pay in return
  - socrates says: for their protection as was sufficient for temperate men, they
  - socrates says: were to spend it in common and pass their lives in company
  - socrates says: with one another, devoting themselves perpetually to the pursuit
  - socrates says: of virtue and relieved from all other occupations.

  - socrates says: Moreover with regard to women we observed that
  - socrates says: their natures must be brought into harmonious similarity with

  - socrates says: to them all both in war and in their general mode of life.

  - socrates says: And what were our rules concerning the pro-
  - socrates says: creation of children ? This, I think, is easy of recollection
  - socrates says: because of the novelty of our scheme. We ordained that the
  - socrates says: rights of marriage and of children should be common to all, to
  - socrates says: the end that no one should ever know his own offspring, but
  - socrates says: that each should look upon all as his kindred, regarding as
  - socrates says: sisters and brethren all such as were between suitable limits of
  - socrates says: age, and those of the former and previous generations as parents
  - socrates says: and grandparents, and those after them as children and children's

  - socrates says: Next with a view to securing immediately the
  - socrates says: utmost possible perfection in their natures, do we not remember
  - socrates says: that it was incumbent on the rulers of both sexes to make
  - socrates says: provision for the contraction of marriages by some secret mode
  - socrates says: of allotment, that to the good and bad separately might be
  - socrates says: allotted mates of their own kind, and so no ill-feeling should

  - socrates says: And the offspring of the good we said must be
  - socrates says: reared, while that of the bad was to be secretly dispersed among
  - socrates says: the other classes of the state ; and continually observing them
  - socrates says: as they grew up, the rulers were to restore to their rank such as
  - socrates says: were worthy, and in the places of those so promoted substitute
  - socrates says: the unworthy in their own rank.

  - socrates says: Listen then and I will tell you in the next
  - socrates says: place what I feel about the constitution which we described.
  - socrates says: My feeling is something like this, suppose a man, on beholding
  - socrates says: beautiful creatures, whether the work of the painter or really
  - socrates says: alive but at rest, should conceive a desire to see them in motion
  - socrates says: and putting into active exercise the qualities which seemed to
  - socrates says: belong to their form this is just what I feel about our city
  - socrates says: which we described - I would fain listen to one who depicted
  - socrates says: her engaged in a becoming manner with other countries in those
  - socrates says: struggles which cities must undergo, and going to war, and
  - socrates says: when at war showing a result worthy of her training and educa-
  - socrates says: tion, both when dealing in action and parleying in speech with
  - socrates says: other cities. Now, Critias and Hermocrates, my own verdict
  - socrates says: upon myself is that I should never be capable of celebrating the
  - socrates says: city and her people according to their merit. So far as concerns
  - socrates says: me indeed, that is no marvel ; but I have formed the same
  - socrates says: opinion about the poets, both past and present ; not that I
  - socrates says: disparage the poetic race, but any one can see that the imitative
  - socrates says: tribe will most easily and perfectly imitate the surroundings
  - socrates says: amid which they have been brought up, but that which lies
  - socrates says: outside the range of each man's experience is hard to imitate
  - socrates says: correctly in actions and yet harder in words. As to the class of
  - socrates says: sophists on the other hand, I have always held them to be well
  - socrates says: furnished with many fine discourses on other subjects ; yet I am
  - socrates says: afraid, seeing they wander from city to city and have never had
  - socrates says: dwellings of their own to manage, they may somehow fall short
  - socrates says: in their conception of philosophers and statesmen, as to what in
  - socrates says: time of war and battles they would do and say in their dealings
  - socrates says: and converse with divers people. One class then remains, those
  - socrates says: who share your habit of mind, having by nature and training a
  - socrates says: capacity for both philosophy and statecraft. Timaeus for in-
  - socrates says: stance, belonging to an admirably governed state, the Italian
  - socrates says: Lokris, and one of the foremost of its citizens in wealth and
  - socrates says: birth, has filled offices of the highest authority and honour in
  - socrates says: his native city, and has also in my judgment climbed to the
  - socrates says: topmost peak of all philosophy -- while at Athens we all know
  - socrates says: that Critias is no novice in any of the questions we are discuss-
  - socrates says: ing -- of Hermocrates too we must believe on the evidence of
  - socrates says: many witnesses that his genius and acquirements qualify him to
  - socrates says: deal with all such matters. This was in my mind yesterday
  - socrates says: when I willingly complied with your request that I should
  - socrates says: repeat the conversation concerning the ideal polity ; for I knew
  - socrates says: that no men were more competent than you, if you were willing,
  - socrates says: to supply the sequel -- no one else indeed at the present day
  - socrates says: could, after engaging our city in an honourable war, render her
  - socrates says: conduct worthy of her in all respects. So after saying all that
  - socrates says: was enjoined on me I in my turn enjoined upon you the task of
  - socrates says: which I now remind you. Accordingly you consulted together
  - socrates says: and agreed to entertain me at this time with a return ' feast of

  - hermocrates says: diately on leaving this spot, when we reached the guest-chamber
  - hermocrates says: at the house of Critias where we are staying, and even before
  - hermocrates says: that on our way thither, we were discussing this very matter.
  - hermocrates says: Critias then told us a story from an old tradition, which you had

  - critias says: I will tell an ancient story that I heard from
  - critias says: a man no longer young. For Critias was then, as he said, hard
  - critias says: upon ninety years of age, while I was about ten. It happened
  - critias says: to be the 'children's day' of the Apaturia ; and then as usual
  - critias says: the boys enjoyed their customary pastime, our fathers giving us
  - critias says: prizes for reciting poetry. A great deal of poetry by various
  - critias says: authors was recited, and since that of Solon was new at the
  - critias says: time, many of us children sang his poems. So one of the clans-
  - critias says: men said, whether he really thought so or whether he wished to
  - critias says: please Critias, he considered that Solon was not only in other
  - critias says: respects the wisest of mankind but also the noblest of all poets
  - critias says: The old man how well I recollect it was extremely pleased
  - critias says: and said smiling, Yes, Amynandros, if he had not treated poetry
  - critias says: merely as a by-work, but had made a serious business of it like
  - critias says: the rest, and if he had finished the legend which he brought
  - critias says: hither from Egypt, instead of being compelled to abandon it by
  - critias says: the factions and other troubles which he found here on his
  - critias says: return, my belief is that neither Hesiod nor Homer nor any
  - critias says: other poet would have enjoyed greater fame than he. What
  - critias says: was the legend, Critias ? asked Amynandros. It concerned a
  - critias says: mighty achievement, he replied, and one that deserved to be the
  - critias says: most famous in the world ; a deed which our city actually per-
  - critias says: formed, but owing to time and the destruction of the doers
  - critias says: thereof the story has not lasted to our times. Tell us from the
  - critias says: beginning, said the other, what was the tale that Solon told, and
  - critias says: how and from whom he heard it as true.
  - critias says: There is in Egypt, said Critias, in the Delta, at the apex of
  - critias says: which the stream of the Nile divides, a province called the
  - critias says: Saitic ; and the chief city of this province is Sais, the birthplace
  - critias says: of Amasis the king. The founder of their city is a goddess,
  - critias says: whose name in the Egyptian tongue is Neith, and in Greek, as
  - critias says: they aver, Athena - the people are great lovers of the Athenians
  - critias says: and claim a certain kinship with our countrymen. Now when
  - critias says: Solon travelled to this city he said he was most honourably
  - critias says: entreated by the citizens; moreover when he questioned con-
  - critias says: cerning ancient things such of the priests as were most versed
  - critias says: therein, he found that neither he nor any other Grecian man,
  - critias says: one might wellnigh say, knew aught about such matters. And
  - critias says: once, when he wished to lead them on to talk of ancient times,
  - critias says: he essayed to tell them of the oldest legends of Hellas, of
  - critias says: Phoroneus who was called the first man, and of Niobe; and
  - critias says: again he told the tale of Deukalion and Pyrrha, how they sur-
  - critias says: vived after the deluge, and he reckoned up their descendants, and
  - critias says: tried, by calculating the periods, to count up the number of
  - critias says: years that passed during the events he related. Then said one
  - critias says: of the priests, a man well stricken in years, O Solon, Solon, ye
  - critias says: Greeks are ever children, and old man that is a Grecian is there
  - critias says: none. And when Solon heard it, he said, What meanest thou
  - critias says: by this ? And the priest said, Ye are all young in your souls ;
  - critias says: for ye have not in them because of old tradition any ancient
  - critias says: belief nor knowledge that is hoary with eld. And the reason of
  - critias says: it is this - many and manifold are the destructions of mankind
  - critias says: that have been and shall be; the greatest are by fire and by
  - critias says: water; but besides these there are lesser ones in countless other
  - critias says: fashions. For indeed that tale that is also told among you, how
  - critias says: that Phaethon, the child of the Sun, yoked his father's chariot,
  - critias says: and for that he could not drive in his father's path, he burnt up
  - critias says: all things upon earth and himself was smitten by a thunderbolt
  - critias says: and slain this story, as it is told, has the fashion of a fable;
  - critias says: but the truth of it is a deviation of the bodies that move round
  - critias says: the earth in the heavens, whereby comes at long intervals of
  - critias says: time a destruction with much fire of the things that are upon
  - critias says: earth. Thus do such as dwell on mountains and in high places
  - critias says: and in dry perish more widely than they who live beside rivers
  - critias says: and by the sea. Now the Nile, which is in all else our preserver,
  - critias says: saves us then also from this distress by releasing his founts - but
  - critias says: when the gods send a flood upon the earth, cleansing her with
  - critias says: waters, those in the mountains are saved, the neatherds and
  - critias says: shepherds, but the inhabitants of the cities in your land are
  - critias says: swept by the rivers into the sea. But in this country neither
  - critias says: then nor at any time does water fall from on high upon the
  - critias says: fields, but contrariwise all rises up by nature from below.
  - critias says: Wherefore and for which causes the legends preserved here are
  - critias says: the most ancient that are told - but the truth is that in all places,
  - critias says: where exceeding cold or heat does not forbid, there are ever
  - critias says: human beings, now more, now fewer. Now whether at Athens
  - critias says: or in Egypt, or in any other place whereof we have tidings, any-
  - critias says: thing noble or great or otherwise notable has occurred, we have
  - critias says: all written down and preserved from ancient times in our temple
  - critias says: here. But with you and other nations the commonwealth has
  - critias says: only just been enriched with letters and all else that cities
  - critias says: require - and again after the wonted term of years like a recur-
  - critias says: ring sickness comes rushing on them the torrent from heaven ;
  - critias says: and it leaves only the unlettered and untaught among you, so
  - critias says: that as it were ye become young again with a new birth, know-
  - critias says: ing nought of what happened in the ancient times either in our
  - critias says: country or in yours. For instance the genealogies, Solon, which
  - critias says: you just now recounted, concerning the people of your country,
  - critias says: are little better than children's tales. For in the first place ye
  - critias says: remember but one deluge, whereas there had been many before
  - critias says: it ; and moreover ye know not that the fairest and noblest race
  - critias says: among mankind lived once in your country, whence ye sprang
  - critias says: and all your city which now is, from a very little seed that of
  - critias says: old was left over. Ye however know it not, because the sur-
  - critias says: vivors lived and died for many generations without utterance in
  - critias says: writing. For once upon a time, Solon, far back beyond the
  - critias says: greatest destruction by waters, that which is now the city of
  - critias says: the Athenians was foremost both in war and in all besides, and
  - critias says: her laws were exceedingly righteous above all cities. Her deeds
  - critias says: and her government are said to have been the noblest among all
  - critias says: under heaven whereof the report has come to our ears. And
  - critias says: Solon said that on hearing this he was astonished, and used all
  - critias says: urgency in entreating the priests to relate to him from beginning
  - critias says: to end all about those ancient citizens. So the priest said, I
  - critias says: grudge thee not, O Solon, and I will tell it for thy sake and for
  - critias says: the sake of thy city, and chiefly for the honour of the goddess
  - critias says: who was the possessor and nurse and instructress both of your
  - critias says: city and of ours ; for she founded yours earlier by a thousand
  - critias says: years, having taken the seed of you from Earth and Hephaistos;
  - critias says: and ours in later time. And the date of our city's foundation is
  - critias says: recorded in our sacred writings to be eight thousand years ago.
  - critias says: But concerning the citizens of Athens nine thousand years ago I
  - critias says: will inform you in brief of their laws and of the noblest of the
  - critias says: deeds which they performed - the exact truth concerning every-
  - critias says: thing we will examine in due order hereafter, taking the actual
  - critias says: records at our leisure.
  - critias says: Consider now their laws in comparison with those of our
  - critias says: country ; for you will find here at the present day many exam-
  - critias says: ples of the laws which then existed among you - first the
  - critias says: separation of the priestly caste from the rest ; next the distinc-
  - critias says: tion of the craftsmen, that each kind plies its own craft by itself
  - critias says: and mingles not with another ; and the class of shepherds and
  - critias says: of hunters and of husbandmen are set apart ; and that of the
  - critias says: warriors too you have surely noticed is here sundered from all
  - critias says: the other classes ; for on them the law enjoins to study the art
  - critias says: of war and nought else. Furthermore there is the fashion of
  - critias says: their arming with spears and shields, wherewith we have been
  - critias says: the first men in Asia to arm ourselves ; for the goddess taught
  - critias says: this to us, as she did first to you in that country of yours.
  - critias says: Again as regards knowledge, you see how careful our law is in
  - critias says: its. first principles, investigating the laws of nature till it arrives
  - critias says: at divination and medicine, the object of which is health, draw-
  - critias says: ing from these divine studies lessons useful for human needs,
  - critias says: and adding to these all the sciences that are connected there-
  - critias says: withal. With all this constitution and order the goddess estab-
  - critias says: lished you when she founded your nation first; choosing out
  - critias says: the spot in which ye were born because she saw that the mild
  - critias says: temperament of its seasons would produce the highest intelli-
  - critias says: gence in its people. Seeing then that the goddess was a lover
  - critias says: of war and of wisdom, she selected the spot that should bring
  - critias says: forth men likest to herself, and therein she first founded your
  - critias says: race. Thus then did ye dwell governed by such laws as I have
  - critias says: described, ay and even better still, surpassing all men in ex-
  - critias says: cellence, as was meet for them that were offspring and nurslings
  - critias says: of gods.
  - critias says:  Many and mighty are the deeds of your city recorded here
  - critias says: for the marvel of men ; but one is there which for greatness and
  - critias says: nobleness surpasses all the rest. For our chronicles tell what a
  - critias says: power your city quelled of old, that marched in wanton inso-
  - critias says: lence upon all Europe and Asia together, issuing yonder from
  - critias says: the Atlantic ocean. For in those days the sea there could be
  - critias says: crossed, since it had an island before the mouth of the strait
  - critias says: is called, as ye say, the pillars of Herakles. Now this
  - critias says: island was greater than Libya and Asia together ; and there-
  - critias says: from there was passage for the sea-farers of those times to the
  - critias says: islands, and from the islands to all the opposite continent
  - critias says: bounds that ocean truly named. For these regions that

  - critias says: narrow entrance ; but the other is ocean verily, and the land
  - critias says: surrounding it may with fullest truth and fitness be named a
  - critias says: continent. In this island Atlantis arose a great and marvellous
  - critias says: might of kings, ruling over all the island itself, and many other
  - critias says: islands, and parts of the mainland; and besides these, of the
  - critias says: lands east of the strait they governed Libya as far as Egypt, and
  - critias says: Europe to the borders of Etruria. So all this power gathered
  - critias says: itself together, and your country and ours and the whole region
  - critias says: within the strait it sought with one single swoop to enslave.
  - critias says: Then, O Solon, did the power of your city shine forth in all
  - critias says: men's eyes glorious in valour and in strength. For being fore-
  - critias says: most upon earth in courage and the arts of war, sometimes she
  - critias says: was leader of the Hellenes, sometimes she stood alone perforce,
  - critias says: when the rest fell away from her; and after being brought into
  - critias says: the uttermost perils, she vanquished the invaders and triumphed
  - critias says: over them - and the nations that were not yet enslaved she pre-
  - critias says: served from slavery; while the rest of us who dwell this side the
  - critias says: pillars of Herakles, all did she set free with ungrudging hand.
  - critias says: But in later time, after there had been exceeding great earth-
  - critias says: quakes and floods, there fell one day and night of destruction;
  - critias says: the warriors in your land all in one body were swallowed up
  - critias says: by the earth, and in like manner did the island Atlantis sink
  - critias says: beneath the sea and vanish away. Wherefore to this day the
  - critias says: there is impassable and unsearchable, being blocked by
  - critias says: very shallow shoals, which the island caused as she settled down.

  - critias says: IV. You have heard this brief statement, Socrates, of what
  - critias says: the ancient Critias reported that he heard from Solon -- and
  - critias says: when you were speaking yesterday about the polity and the
  - critias says: men whom you described, I was amazed as I called to mind the
  - critias says: story I have just told you, remarking how by some miraculous
  - critias says: coincidence most of your account agreed unerringly with the
  - critias says: description of Solon. I was unwilling however to say anything
  - critias says: at the moment, for after so long a time my memory was at
  - critias says: fault. I conceived therefore that I must not speak until I had
  - critias says: thoroughly gone over the whole story by myself. Accordingly
  - critias says: I was quick to accept the task you imposed on us yesterday,
  - critias says: thinking that for the most arduous part of all such undertakings,
  - critias says: I mean supplying a story fitly corresponding to our intentions,
  - critias says: we should be fairly well provided. So then, as Hermocrates
  - critias says: said, as soon as ever I departed hence yesterday, I began to
  - critias says: repeat the legend to our friends as I remembered it; and when
  - critias says: I got home I recovered nearly the whole of it by thinking it
  - critias says: over at night. How true is the saying that what we learn in
  - critias says: childhood has a wonderful hold on the memory. Of what I
  - critias says: heard yesterday I know not if I could call to mind the whole -
  - critias says: but though it is so very long since I heard this tale, I should be
  - critias says: surprised if a single point in it has escaped me. It was with
  - critias says: much boyish delight that I listened at the time, and the
  - critias says: old man was glad to instruct me, (for I asked a great many
  - critias says: questions) ; so that it is indelibly fixed in my mind, like those
  - critias says: encaustic pictures which cannot be effaced. And I narrated the
  - critias says: story to the rest the first thing in the morning, that they might
  - critias says: share my affluence of words. Now therefore, to return to the
  - critias says: object of all our conversation, I am ready to speak, Socrates,
  - critias says: not only in general terms, but entering into details, as I heard it.
  - critias says: The citizens and the city which you yesterday described to us
  - critias says: as in a fable we will transfer to the sphere of reality and to
  - critias says: our own country, and we will suppose that ancient Athens is
  - critias says: your ideal commonwealth, and say that the citizens whom you
  - critias says: imagined are those veritable forefathers of ours of whom the
  - critias says: priest spoke. They will fit exactly, and there will be nothing
  - critias says: discordant in saying that they were the men who lived in those
  - critias says: days. And dividing the work between us we will all endeavour
  - critias says: to render an appropriate fulfilment of your injunctions. So you
  - critias says: must consider, Socrates, whether this story of ours satisfies you,
  - critias says: or whether we must look for another in its stead.

  - timaeus says: Yes indeed, Socrates, that is what all do who
  - timaeus says: possess the slightest share of judgment ; at the outset of every
  - timaeus says: work, great or small, they always call upon a god - and seeing
  - timaeus says: that we are going to enter on a discussion of the universe, how
  - timaeus says: far it is created or perchance uncreate, unless we are altogether
  - timaeus says: beside ourselves, we must needs invoke the gods and goddesses
  - timaeus says: and pray above all that our discourse may be pleasing in their
  - timaeus says: sight, next that it may be consistent with itself. Let it suffice
  - timaeus says: then thus to have called upon the gods ; but we must call upon
  - timaeus says: ourselves likewise to conduct the discourse in such a way that
  - timaeus says: you will most readily comprehend me, and I shall most fully carry
  - timaeus says: out my intentions in expounding the subject that is before us.

  - timaeus says: First then in my judgment this distinction must be made.
  - timaeus says: What is that which is eternally and has no becoming, and again
  - timaeus says: what is that which comes to be but is never? The one is com-
  - timaeus says: prehensible by thought with the aid of reason, ever changeless;
  - timaeus says: the other opinable by opinion with the aid of reasonless sensa-
  - timaeus says: tion, becoming and perishing, never truly existent. Now all
  - timaeus says: that comes to be must needs be brought into being by some
  - timaeus says: cause - for it is impossible for anything without a cause to
  - timaeus says: attain to birth. Of whatsoever thing then the Artificer, looking
  - timaeus says: ever to the changeless and using that as his model, works out
  - timaeus says: the design and function, all that is so accomplished must needs
  - timaeus says: be fair - but if he look to that which has come to be, using the
  - timaeus says: created as his model, the work is not fair. Now as to the whole
  - timaeus says: heaven or order of the universe for whatsoever name is most
  - timaeus says: acceptable to it, be it so named by us we must first ask con-
  - timaeus says: cerning it the question which lies at the outset of every inquiry,
  - timaeus says: whether did it exist eternally, having no beginning of generation,
  - timaeus says: or has it come into being, starting from some beginning? It
  - timaeus says: has come into being - for it can be seen and felt and has body ;
  - timaeus says: and all such things are sensible, and sensible things, apprehen-
  - timaeus says: sible by opinion with sensation, belong, as we saw, to becoming
  - timaeus says: and creation. We say that what has come to be must be
  - timaeus says: brought into being by some cause. Now the maker and father
  - timaeus says: of this All it were a hard task to find, and having found him, it
  - timaeus says: were impossible to declare him to all men. However we must
  - timaeus says: again inquire concerning him, after which of the models did the
  - timaeus says: framer of it fashion the universe, after the changeless and abid-
  - timaeus says: ing, or after that which has come into being? If now this
  - timaeus says: niverse is fair and its Artificer good, it is plain that he looked
  - timaeus says: to the eternal ; but if nay it may not even be uttered without
  - timaeus says: impiety, then it was to that which has come into being. Now
  - timaeus says: it is manifest to every one that he looked to the eternal - for the
  - timaeus says: universe is fairest of all things that have come to be, and he is
  - timaeus says: the most excellent of causes. And having come on this wise
  - timaeus says: into being it has been created in the image of that which is
  - timaeus says: comprehensible by reason and wisdom and changes never.
  - timaeus says: Granting this, it must needs be that this universe is a likeness of
  - timaeus says: something. Now it is all-important to make our beginning
  - timaeus says: according to nature - and this affirmation must be laid down
  - timaeus says: with regard to a likeness and its model, that the words must be
  - timaeus says: akin to the subjects of which they are the interpreters - there-
  - timaeus says: fore of that which is abiding and sure and discoverable by the
  - timaeus says: aid of reason the words too must be abiding and unchanging,
  - timaeus says: and so far as it lies in words to be incontrovertible and immova-
  - timaeus says: ble, they must in no wise fall short of this ; but those which deal
  - timaeus says: with that which is made in the image of the former and which is
  - timaeus says: a likeness must be likely and duly corresponding with their
  - timaeus says: subject - as being is to becoming, so is truth to belief. If then,
  - timaeus says: Socrates, after so many men have said divers things concerning
  - timaeus says: the gods and the generation of the universe, we should not prove
  - timaeus says: able to render an account everywhere and in all respects con-
  - timaeus says: sistent and accurate, let no one be surprised ; but if we can
  - timaeus says: produce one as probable as any other, we must be content,
  - timaeus says: remembering that I who speak and you my judges are but men -
  - timaeus says: so that on these subjects we should be satisfied with the probable

  - timaeus says: Let us declare then for what cause nature
  - timaeus says: and this All was framed by him that framed it. He was good,
  - timaeus says: and in none that is good can there arise jealousy of aught at
  - timaeus says: any time. So being far aloof from this, he desired that all things
  - timaeus says: should be as like unto himself as possible. This is that most
  - timaeus says: sovereign cause of nature and the universe which we shall most
  - timaeus says: surely be right in accepting from men of understanding. For
  - timaeus says: God desiring that all things should be good, and that, so far as
  - timaeus says: this might be, there should be nought evil, having received all
  - timaeus says: that is visible not in a state of rest, but moving without harmony
  - timaeus says: or measure, brought it from its disorder into order, thinking that
  - timaeus says: this was in all ways better than the other. Now it neither has
  - timaeus says: been nor is permitted to the most perfect to do aught but what
  - timaeus says: is most fair. Therefore he took thought and perceived that of
  - timaeus says: all things which are by nature visible, no work that is without
  - timaeus says: reason will ever be fairer than that which has reason, setting
  - timaeus says: whole against whole, and that without soul reason cannot dwell
  - timaeus says: in anything. Because then he argued thus, in forming the
  - timaeus says: universe he created reason in soul and soul in body, that he
  - timaeus says: might be the maker of a work that was by nature most fair and
  - timaeus says: perfect. In this way then we ought to affirm according to the
  - timaeus says: probable account that this universe is a living creature in very
  - timaeus says: truth possessing soul and reason by the providence of God.

  - timaeus says: Having attained thus far, we must go on to tell what follows -
  - timaeus says: after the similitude of what animal its framer fashioned it. To
  - timaeus says: none of these which naturally belong to the class of the partial
  - timaeus says: must we deign to liken it - for nothing that is like to the im-
  - timaeus says: perfect could ever become fair ; but that of which the other
  - timaeus says: animals severally and in their kinds are portions, to this above
  - timaeus says: all things we must declare that the universe is most like. For
  - timaeus says: that comprehends and contains in itself all ideal animals, even as
  - timaeus says: this universe contains us and all other creatures that have been
  - timaeus says: formed to be visible. For since God desired to liken it most
  - timaeus says: nearly to what is fairest of the objects of reason and in all respects
  - timaeus says: perfect, he made it a single visible living being, containing within
  - timaeus says: itself all animals that are by nature akin to it. Are we right
  - timaeus says: then in affirming the universe to be one, or had it been more true
  - timaeus says: to speak of a great and boundless number ? One it must be, if
  - timaeus says: it is to be created according to its pattern. For that which
  - timaeus says: comprehends all ideal animals that are could never be a second
  - timaeus says: in company of another- for there must again exist another
  - timaeus says: animal comprehending them, whereof the two would be parts,
  - timaeus says: and no longer to them but to that which comprehended them
  - timaeus says: should we more truly affirm the universe to have been likened.
  - timaeus says: To the end then that in its solitude this universe might be like
  - timaeus says: the all-perfect animal, the maker made neither two universes nor
  - timaeus says: an infinite number ; but as it has come into being, this universe
  - timaeus says: one and only-begotten, so it is and shall be for ever.

  - timaeus says: Now that which came into being must be material and
  - timaeus says: such as can be seen and touched. Apart from fire nothing
  - timaeus says: could ever become visible, nor without something solid could it
  - timaeus says: be tangible, and solid cannot exist without earth - therefore did
  - timaeus says: God when he set about to frame the body of the universe form
  - timaeus says: it of fire and of earth. But it is not possible for two things
  - timaeus says: to be fairly united without a third; for they need a bond between
  - timaeus says: them which shall join them both. The best of bonds is that
  - timaeus says: which makes itself and those which it binds as complete a unity
  - timaeus says: as possible ; and the nature of proportion is to accomplish this
  - timaeus says: most perfectly. For when of any three numbers, whether ex-
  - timaeus says: pressing three or two dimensions, one is a mean term, so that as
  - timaeus says: the first is to the middle, so is the middle to the last ; and con-
  - timaeus says: versely as the last is to the middle, so is the middle to the first ; then
  - timaeus says: since the middle becomes first and last, and the last and the first
  - timaeus says: both become middle, of necessity all will come to be the same, and
  - timaeus says: being the same with one another all will be a unity. Now if the
  - timaeus says: body of the universe were to have been made a plane surface
  - timaeus says: having no thickness, one mean would have sufficed to unify itself
  - timaeus says: and the extremes ; but now since it behoved it to be solid,
  - timaeus says: and since solids can never be united by one mean, but require two
  - timaeus says: God accordingly set air and water betwixt fire and earth, and
  - timaeus says: making them as far as possible exactly proportional, so that fire
  - timaeus says: is to air as air to water, and as air is to water water is to earth,
  - timaeus says: thus he compacted and constructed a universe visible and tangible.
  - timaeus says: For these reasons and out of elements of this kind, four in
  - timaeus says: number, the body of the universe was created, being brought
  - timaeus says: into concord through proportion ; and from these it derived
  - timaeus says: friendship, so that coming to unity with itself it became in-
  - timaeus says: dissoluble by any force save the will of him who joined it.
  - show timaeus: AT CENTER
  - show timaeus: talk AT CENTER
  - timaeus says: Now the making of the universe took up the whole bulk of
  - timaeus says: each of these four elements. Of all fire and all water and air
  - timaeus says: and earth its framer fashioned it, leaving over no part nor power
  - timaeus says: without. Therein he had this intent - first that it might be
  - timaeus says: that it might be one, seeing that nothing was left over whereof
  - timaeus says: a creature perfect to the utmost with all its parts perfect; next
  - timaeus says: another should be formed ; furthermore that it might be free
  - timaeus says: from age and sickness ; for he reflected that when hot things
  - timaeus says: and cold and all such as have strong powers gather round a
  - timaeus says: composite body from without and fall unseasonably upon it,
  - timaeus says: they undermine it, and bringing upon it sickness and age cause
  - timaeus says: its decay. For such motives and reasons he fashioned it as one
  - timaeus says: whole, with each of its parts whole in itself, so as to be perfect
  - timaeus says: and free from age and sickness. And he assigned to it its
  - timaeus says: proper and natural shape. To that which is to comprehend all
  - timaeus says: animals in itself that shape seems proper which comprehends in
  - timaeus says: itself all shapes that are. Wherefore he turned it of a rounded
  - timaeus says: and spherical shape, having its bounding surface in all points at
  - timaeus says: an equal distance from the centre - this being the most perfect
  - timaeus says: and regular shape ; for he thought that a regular shape was
  - timaeus says: infinitely fairer than an irregular. And all round about he
  - timaeus says: finished off the outer surface perfectly smooth, for many
  - timaeus says: reasons. It needed not eyes, for naught visible was left
  - timaeus says: outside; nor hearing, for there was nothing to hear; and there
  - timaeus says: was no surrounding air which made breathing needful. Nor
  - timaeus says: must it have any organ whereby it should receive into itself its
  - timaeus says: sustenance, and again reject that which was already digested ;
  - timaeus says: for nothing went forth of it nor entered in from anywhere ; for
  - timaeus says: there was nothing. For by design was it created to supply its
  - timaeus says: own sustenance by its own wasting, and to have all its action
  - timaeus says: and passion in itself and by itself - for its framer deemed that
  - timaeus says: were it self-sufficing it would be far better than if it required
  - timaeus says: aught else. And hands, wherewith it had no need to grasp
  - timaeus says: aught nor to defend itself against another, he thought not fit idly
  - timaeus says: to bestow upon it, nor yet feet, nor in a word anything to serve
  - timaeus says: as the means of movement. For he assigned it that motion
  - timaeus says: which was proper to its bodily form, of all the seven that which
  - timaeus says: most belongs to reason and intelligence. Wherefore turning it
  - timaeus says: about uniformly in the same spot on its own axis, he made it to
  - timaeus says: revolve round and round ; but all the six motions he took away
  - timaeus says: from it and left it without part in their wanderings. And since
  - timaeus says: for this revolution there was no need of feet he made it without
  - timaeus says: legs and without feet.

  - timaeus says: So the universal design of the ever-living God, that
  - timaeus says: he planned for the God that was some time to be, made its
  - timaeus says: surface smooth and even, everywhere equally distant from the
  - timaeus says: centre, a body whole and perfect out of perfect bodies. And
  - timaeus says: God set soul in the midst thereof and spread her through all its
  - timaeus says: body and even wrapped the body about with her from without,
  - timaeus says: and he made it a sphere in a circle revolving, a universe one and
  - timaeus says: alone ; but for its excellence it was able to be company to itself
  - timaeus says: and needed no other, being sufficient for itself as acquaintance
  - timaeus says: and friend. For all these things then he created it a happy god.
  - timaeus says: But the soul was not made by God younger than the body,
  - timaeus says: even as she comes later in this account we are essaying to give ;
  - timaeus says: for he would not when he had joined them together have suffered
  - timaeus says: the elder to be governed by the younger - but we are far too
  - timaeus says: prone to a casual and random habit of mind which shows itself
  - timaeus says: in our speech. God made soul in birth and in excellence
  - timaeus says: earlier and elder than body, to be its mistress and governor ; and
  - timaeus says: he framed her out of the following elements and in the following
  - timaeus says: way. From the undivided and ever changeless substance and
  - timaeus says: that which becomes divided in material bodies, of both these he
  - timaeus says: mingled in the third place the form of Essence, in the midst
  - timaeus says: between the Same and the Other; and this he composed on such
  - timaeus says: wise between the undivided and that which is in material bodies
  - timaeus says: divided ; and taking them, three in number, he blended them
  - timaeus says: into one form, forcing the nature of the Other, hard as it was to
  - timaeus says: mingle, into union with the Same. And mingling them with
  - timaeus says: Essence and of the three making one, again he divided this into
  - timaeus says: as many parts as was meet, each part mingled of Same and
  - timaeus says: he took one portion from the whole ; then he went on to take a
  - timaeus says: of Other and of Essence. And he began his dividing thus - first
  - timaeus says: portion double of this ; and the third half as much again as the
  - timaeus says: second and triple of the first; the fourth double of the second ;
  - timaeus says: the fifth three times the third ; the sixth eight times the first,
  - timaeus says: the seventh twenty-seven times the first. After that, he filled up
  - timaeus says: the interval between the powers of two and of three by severing
  - timaeus says: yet more from the original mass and placing it between them in
  - timaeus says: such a manner that within each interval were two means, the
  - timaeus says: first exceeding one extreme in the same proportion as it was
  - timaeus says: exceeded by the other, the second by the same number exceed-
  - timaeus says: ing the one as it was exceeded by the other. And whereas by
  - timaeus says: these links there were formed in the original intervals new
  - timaeus says: intervals of f and f and , he went on to fill up all the intervals
  - timaeus says: of f with that of f, leaving in each a fraction over ; and the
  - timaeus says: terms of the interval forming this fraction are in the numerical
  - timaeus says: proportion of 2$6 to 243. By this time the mixture, whence he
  - timaeus says: cut off these portions, was all used up. Next he cleft the
  - timaeus says: structure so formed lengthwise into two halves, and laying the
  - timaeus says: two so as to meet in the centre in the shape of the letter X, he
  - timaeus says: bent them into a circle and joined them, causing them to meet
  - timaeus says: themselves and each other at a point opposite to that of their
  - timaeus says: original contact - and he comprehended them in the motion that
  - timaeus says: revolves uniformly on the same axis, and one of the circles he
  - timaeus says: made exterior and one interior. The exterior motion he named
  - timaeus says: the motion of the Same, the interior that of the Other. And

  - timaeus says: double and triple intervals severally, each being three in number;

  - timaeus says: Now after that the framing of the soul was finished to
  - timaeus says: the mind of him that framed her, next he fashioned within her
  - timaeus says: all that is bodily, and he drew them together and fitted them
  - timaeus says: middle to middle. And from the midst even unto the ends
  - timaeus says: of heaven she was woven in everywhere and encompassed it
  - timaeus says: around from without, and having her movement in herself
  - timaeus says: she began a divine beginning of endless and reasonable life for
  - timaeus says: ever and evermore. Now the body of the universe has been
  - timaeus says: created visible ; but she is invisible, and she, even soul, has part
  - timaeus says: in reason and in harmony. And whereas she is made by the
  - timaeus says: best of all whereunto belong reason and eternal being, so she is
  - timaeus says: the best of all that is brought into being. Therefore since she is
  - timaeus says: formed of the nature of Same and of Other and of Being, of these
  - timaeus says: three portions blended, in due proportion divided and bound
  - timaeus says: together, and turns about and returns into herself, whenever she
  - timaeus says: touches aught that has manifold existence or aught that has
  - timaeus says: undivided, she is stirred through all her substance, and she tells
  - timaeus says: that wherewith the thing is same and that wherefrom it is
  - timaeus says: different, and in what relation or place or manner or time
  - timaeus says: it comes to pass both in the region of the changing and in the
  - timaeus says: region of the changeless that each thing affects another and
  - timaeus says: is affected. This word of hers is true alike, whether it deal with
  - timaeus says: Same or with Other, without voice or sound in the Self-moved
  - timaeus says: arising ; and when she is busied with the sensible, and the circle
  - timaeus says: of the Other, being true, announces it throughout all the soul,
  - timaeus says: then are formed sure opinions and true beliefs ; and when she is
  - timaeus says: busy with the rational, and the circle of the Same declares
  - timaeus says: it, running smoothly, then reason and knowledge cannot but be
  - timaeus says: made perfect. And in whatsoever existing thing these two are
  - timaeus says: found, if a man affirm it is aught but soul, what he says will be
  - timaeus says: anything rather than the truth.

  - timaeus says: And when the father who begat it perceived the created
  - timaeus says: image of the eternal gods, that it had motion and life, he re-
  - timaeus says: joiced and was well pleased ; and he bethought him to make it
  - timaeus says: yet more nearly like its pattern. Now whereas that is a living
  - timaeus says: being eternally existent, even so he essayed to make this All the
  - timaeus says: like to the best of his power. Now so it was that the nature of
  - timaeus says: the ideal was eternal. But to bestow this attribute altogether
  - timaeus says: upon a created thing was impossible ; so he bethought him to
  - timaeus says: make a moving image of eternity, and while he was ordering
  - timaeus says: the universe he made of eternity that abides in unity an eternal
  - timaeus says: image moving according to number, even that which we have
  - timaeus says: named time. For whereas days and nights and months and
  - timaeus says: years were not before the universe was created, he then devised
  - timaeus says: the generation of them along with the fashioning of the universe.
  - timaeus says: Now all these are portions of time, and was and shall be are
  - timaeus says: forms of time that have come to be, although we wrongly
  - timaeus says: ascribe them unawares to the eternal essence. For we say that
  - timaeus says: it was and is and shall be, but in verity is alone belongs to it -
  - timaeus says: and was and shall be it is meet should be applied only to
  - timaeus says: Becoming which moves in time ; for these are motions. But
  - timaeus says: that which is ever changeless without motion must not become
  - timaeus says: elder or younger in time, neither must it have become so in the
  - timaeus says: past nor be so in the future ; nor has it to do with any attributes
  - timaeus says: that Becoming attaches to the moving objects of sense - these
  - timaeus says: have come into being as forms of time, which is the image of
  - timaeus says: eternity and revolves according to number. Moreover we say
  - timaeus says: that the become is the become, and the becoming is the be-
  - timaeus says: coming, and that which shall become is that which shall become,
  - timaeus says: and not-being is not-being. In all this we speak incorrectly.
  - timaeus says: But concerning these things the present were perchance not the

  - timaeus says: Time then has come into being along with the universe,
  - timaeus says: that being generated together, together they may be dissolved,
  - timaeus says: should a dissolution of them ever come to pass ; and it was
  - timaeus says: made after the pattern of the eternal nature, that it might be as
  - timaeus says: like to it as was possible. For the pattern is existent for all
  - timaeus says: eternity ; but the copy has been and is and shall be throughout
  - timaeus says: all time continually. So then this was the plan and intent of
  - timaeus says: God for the generation of time ; the sun and the moon and five
  - timaeus says: other stars which have the name of planets have been created
  - timaeus says: for defining and preserving the numbers of time. And when
  - timaeus says: God had made their several bodies, he set them in the orbits
  - timaeus says: wherein the revolution of the Other was moving, in seven circles
  - timaeus says: seven stars. The moon he placed in that nearest the earth, and
  - timaeus says: in the second above the earth he set the sun ; and the morning-
  - timaeus says: star and that which is held sacred to Hermes he assigned to
  - timaeus says: those that moved in an orbit having equal speed with the sun,
  - timaeus says: but having a contrary tendency - wherefore the sun and Hermes
  - timaeus says: and the morning star in like manner overtake and are over-
  - timaeus says: taken one by another. And as to the rest, were we to set forth
  - timaeus says: all the orbits wherein he put them and the causes wherefore he
  - timaeus says: did so, the account, though only by the way, would lay on us a
  - timaeus says: heavier task than that which was our chief object in giving it.

  - timaeus says: But when each of the beings which were to join in creating
  - timaeus says: time had arrived in its proper orbit, and had been generated as
  - timaeus says: animate creatures, their bodies secured with living bonds, and
  - timaeus says: had learnt their appointed task ; then in the motion of the
  - timaeus says: Other, which was slanting and crossed the motion of the Same
  - timaeus says: and was thereby controlled, whereas one of these planets had a
  - timaeus says: larger, another a smaller circuit, the lesser orbit was completed
  - timaeus says: more swiftly, the larger more slowly - but because of the motion
  - timaeus says: of the Same those which revolved most swiftly seemed to be
  - timaeus says: overtaken by those that went more slowly, though really they
  - timaeus says: overtook them. For the motion of the Same, twisting all their
  - timaeus says: circles into spirals, because they have a separate and simul-
  - timaeus says: taneous motion in the opposite way, being of all the swiftest
  - timaeus says: displays closest to itself that which departs most slowly from
  - timaeus says: it. And that there might be some clear measure of the relative
  - timaeus says: swiftness and slowness with which they moved in their eight
  - timaeus says: revolutions, God kindled a light in the second orbit from the
  - timaeus says: earth, which we now have named the sun, in order that it might
  - timaeus says: shine most brightly to the ends of heaven, and that living
  - timaeus says: things, so many as was meet, should possess number, learning it
  - timaeus says: from the motion of the same and uniform. Night then and day
  - timaeus says: have been created in this manner and for these causes ; and
  - timaeus says: this is one revolution of the undivided and most intelligent
  - timaeus says: circuit ; and a month is fulfilled when the moon, after com-
  - timaeus says: pleting her own orbit, overtakes the sun ; a year, when the sun
  - timaeus says: has completed his own course. But the courses of the others
  - timaeus says: men have not taken into account, save a few out of many ; and
  - timaeus says: they neither give them names nor measure them against one
  - timaeus says: another, comparing them by means of numbers nay I may
  - timaeus says: say they do not know that time arises from the wanderings of
  - timaeus says: these, which are incalculable in multitude and marvellously
  - timaeus says: intricate. None the less however can we observe that the
  - timaeus says: perfect number of time fulfils the perfect year at the moment
  - timaeus says: when the relative swiftnesses of all the eight revolutions ac-
  - timaeus says:   complish their course together and reach their starting-point,
  - timaeus says: being measured by-the circle of the same and uniformly moving.
  - timaeus says: In this way then and for these causes were created all such of
  - timaeus says: the stars as wander through the heavens and turn about therein,
  - timaeus says: in order that this universe may be most like to the perfect and
  - timaeus says: ideal animal by its assimilation to the eternal being.

  - timaeus says: but in that it did not yet contain all living creatures created
  - timaeus says: within it, herein it was still unlike. So he went on to complete
  - timaeus says: this that remained unfinished, moulding it after the nature of the
  - timaeus says: pattern. So many forms then as Mind perceived to exist in the
  - timaeus says: ideal animal, according to their variety and multitude, such

  - timaeus says: third whatso dwells in the water, and fourth that which goes
  - timaeus says: upon dry land. The visible form of the deities he created
  - timaeus says: chiefly of fire, that it might be most radiant and most fair to
  - timaeus says: behold ; and likening it to the All he shaped it like a sphere
  - timaeus says: and assigned it to the intelligence of the supreme to follow after
  - timaeus says: it ; and he disposed it throughout all the firmament of heaven,
  - timaeus says: to be an adornment of it in very truth, wrought cunningly over
  - timaeus says: the whole expanse. And he bestowed two movements upon
  - timaeus says: each, one in the same spot and uniform, whereby it should be
  - timaeus says: ever constant to its own thoughts concerning the same thing;
  - timaeus says: the other forward, but controlled by the revolution of the same
  - timaeus says: and uniform - but for the other five movements he made it

  - timaeus says: completeness of perfection. From which cause have been

  - timaeus says: as they will, he who begat this universe spake to them these words-
  - timaeus says: Gods of gods, whose creator am I and father of works, which
  - timaeus says: by me coming into being are indissoluble save by my will -
  - timaeus says: Behold, all which hath been fastened may be loosed, yet to
  - timaeus says: loose that which is well fitted and in good case were the will of

  - timaeus says: found in my will a bond yet mightier and more sovereign than

  - timaeus says: Now therefore hearken to the word that I declare unto you.
  - timaeus says: Three kinds of mortal beings are yet uncreate. And if these
  - timaeus says: be not created, the heaven will be imperfect; for it will not
  - timaeus says: have within it all kinds of living things; yet these it must have,
  - timaeus says: if it is to be perfect. But if these were created by my hands

  - timaeus says: he mingled and blended the universal soul he poured what was
  - timaeus says: left of the former, mingling it somewhat after the same manner,
  - timaeus says: yet no longer so pure as before but second and third in pure-
  - timaeus says: ness. And when he had compounded the whole, he portioned
  - timaeus says: off souls equal in number to the stars and distributed a soul to
  - timaeus says: each star, and setting them in the stars as though in a chariot,
  - timaeus says: he shewed them the nature of the universe and declared to
  - timaeus says: them its fated laws; how that the first incarnation should be
  - timaeus says: ordained to be the same for all, that none might suffer dis-
  - timaeus says: advantage at his hands ; and how they must be sown into the
  - timaeus says: instruments of time, each into that which was meet for it, and
  - timaeus says: be born as the most god-fearing of all living creatures ; and
  - timaeus says: whereas human nature was twofold, the stronger was that race
  - timaeus says: which should hereafter be called man. When therefore they
  - timaeus says: should be of necessity implanted in bodily forms, and of their
  - timaeus says: bodies something should ever be coming in and other passing
  - timaeus says: away, in the first place they must needs all have innate one and
  - timaeus says: the same faculty of sense, arising from forcible affections ; next
  - timaeus says: love mingled with pleasure and pain ; and besides these fear
  - timaeus says: and wrath and all the feelings that accompany these and such
  - timaeus says: as are of a contrary nature - and should they master these
  - timaeus says: passions, they would live in righteousness ; if otherwise, in un-

  - timaeus says: time should be conveyed once more to a habitation in his
  - timaeus says: kindred star, and there should enjoy a blissful and congenial
  - timaeus says: life- but failing of this, he should pass in the second incar-
  - timaeus says: nation into the nature of a woman ; and if in this condition he
  - timaeus says: still would not turn from the evil of his ways, then, according
  - timaeus says: to the manner of his wickedness, he should ever be changed
  - timaeus says: into the nature of some beast in such form of incarnation as
  - timaeus says: fitted his disposition, and should not rest from the weariness of
  - timaeus says: these transformations, until by following the revolution that is

  - timaeus says: and making of all the elements one body for each creature, they
  - timaeus says: confined the revolutions of the immortal soul in a body in-
  - timaeus says: flowing and out-flowing continually. And they, being confined
  - timaeus says: in a great river, neither controlled it nor were controlled, but
  - timaeus says: bore and were borne violently to and fro ; so that the whole
  - timaeus says: creature moved, but advanced at random without order or
  - timaeus says: method, having all the six motions - for they moved forward
  - timaeus says: and backward and again to right and to left and downward and
  - timaeus says: upward, and in every way went straying in the six directions.
  - timaeus says: For great as was the tide sweeping over them and flowing off
  - timaeus says: which brought them sustenance, a yet greater tumult was caused
  - timaeus says: by the effects of the bodies that struck against them ; as when
  - timaeus says: the body of any one came in contact with some alien fire that
  - timaeus says: met it from without, or with solid earth, or with liquid glidings
  - timaeus says: of water, or if he were caught in a tempest of winds borne on
  - timaeus says: the air, and so the motions from all these elements rushing
  - timaeus says: through the body penetrated to the soul. This is in fact the
  - timaeus says: reason why these have all alike been called and still are called
  - timaeus says: sensations (atcr^o-et?). Then too did they produce the most
  - timaeus says: wide and vehement agitation for the time being, joining with the
  - timaeus says: perpetually streaming current in stirring and violently shaking
  - timaeus says: the revolutions of the soul, so that they altogether hindered the
  - timaeus says: circle of the Same by flowing contrary to it, and they stopped
  - timaeus says: it from governing and from going ; while the circle of the Other
  - timaeus says: they displaced, so that the double and triple intervals, being
  - timaeus says: three of each sort, and the means and junctures of f and f and ,
  - timaeus says: since they could not be utterly undone save by him that joined
  - timaeus says: them, were forced by them to turn in all kinds of ways and to
  - timaeus says: admit all manner of breaking and twisting of the circles, in
  - timaeus says: every possible form, so that they can barely hold to one another,
  - timaeus says: and though they are in motion, it is motion without law, some-
  - timaeus says: times reversed, now slanting, and now inverted. It is as though
  - timaeus says: a man should stand on his head, resting it on the earth and
  - timaeus says: supporting his feet against something aloft ; in this case the man
  - timaeus says: in such condition and the spectators would reciprocally see right
  - timaeus says: and left reversed in the persons of each other. The same and
  - timaeus says: similar effects are produced with great intensity in the souls
  - timaeus says: revolutions - and when from external objects there meets them
  - timaeus says: anything that belongs to the class of the Same or to that of the
  - timaeus says: Other, then they declare its relative sameness or difference quite
  - timaeus says: contrariwise to the truth, and show themselves false and irra-
  - timaeus says: tional ; and no circuit is governor or leader in them at that
  - timaeus says: time. And whenever sensations from without rushing up and fall-
  - timaeus says: ing upon them drag along with them the whole vessel of the soul,
  - timaeus says: then the circuits seem to govern though they really are governed.

  - timaeus says: On account then of all these experiences the soul is at first
  - timaeus says: bereft of reason, now as in the beginning, when she is confined in
  - timaeus says: a mortal body. But when the stream of growth and nutriment
  - timaeus says: flows in with smaller volume, and the revolutions calming down
  - timaeus says: go their own way and become settled as time passes on, then
  - timaeus says: the orbits are reduced to the form that belongs to the several
  - timaeus says: circles in their natural motion, and declaring accurately the
  - timaeus says: Other and the Same, they set their possessor in the way to
  - timaeus says: become rational. And if any just discipline of education help

  - timaeus says: Imitating the shape of the universe, which was sphe-
  - timaeus says: rical, they confined the two divine revolutions in a globe-shaped
  - timaeus says: body, the same that we now call the head, which is the divinest
  - timaeus says: part of us and has dominion over all our members. To this the
  - timaeus says: gods gave the whole body, when they had put it together, to
  - timaeus says: minister to it, reflecting that it possessed all the motions that
  - timaeus says: should be. In order then that it might not have to roll upon
  - timaeus says: the earth, which has hills and hollows of all kinds, nor be at
  - timaeus says: a loss to surmount the one and climb out of the other, they gave
  - timaeus says: it the body for a conveyance and for ease of going - whence the
  - timaeus says: body was endowed with length and grew four limbs that could
  - timaeus says: be stretched and bent, which the god devised for it to go withal,
  - timaeus says: and by means of which clinging and supporting itself it is
  - timaeus says: enabled to pass through every place, bearing at the top of us
  - timaeus says: the habitation of the most divine and sacred element. In this
  - timaeus says: way then and for these reasons were legs and hands added to
  - timaeus says: all mankind ; and the gods, deeming that the front was more
  - timaeus says: honourable than the back and more fit to lead, made us to move
  - timaeus says: for the most part in this direction. So it behoved man to have
  - timaeus says: the front part distinguished and unlike the back. Therefore
  - timaeus says: having set the face upon the globe of the head on that side, they
  - timaeus says: attached to it organs for all the forethought of the soul, and
  - timaeus says: they ordained that this which had the faculty of guidance should
  - timaeus says: be by nature the front. And first of the organs they wrought light-
  - timaeus says: giving eyes, which they fixed there on the plan I shall explain.
  - timaeus says: Such sort of fire as had the property of yielding a gentle light
  - timaeus says: but not of burning, they contrived to form into a substance akin
  - timaeus says: to the light of every day. The fire within us, which is akin to
  - timaeus says: the daylight, they made to flow pure smooth and dense through
  - timaeus says: the eyes, having made close the whole fabric of the eyes and
  - timaeus says: especially the pupils, so that they kept back all that was coarser
  - timaeus says: and suffered only this to filter through unmixed and pure.
  - timaeus says: Whenever then there is daylight surrounding the current of
  - timaeus says: vision, then this issues forth as like into like, and coalescing with
  - timaeus says: the light is formed into one uniform substance in the direct line
  - timaeus says: of vision, wherever the stream issuing from within strikes upon
  - timaeus says: some external object that falls in its way. So the whole from
  - timaeus says: its uniformity becomes sympathetic ; and whenever it comes in
  - timaeus says: contact with anything else, or anything with it, it passes on the
  - timaeus says: motions thereof over the whole body until they reach the soul,
  - timaeus says: and thus causes that sensation which we call seeing. But when
  - timaeus says: its kindred fire departs into night, the visual current is cut off-
  - timaeus says: for issuing into an alien element it is itself changed and quenched,
  - timaeus says: having no longer a common nature with the surrounding air,
  - timaeus says: which has in it no fire. Therefore it ceases from seeing and
  - timaeus says: moreover becomes an allurement to sleep. For the gods had
  - timaeus says: devised as a safeguard of the sight the structure of the eyelids ;
  - timaeus says: and when these are closed, they shut up the force of fire within ;
  - timaeus says: and this smoothes and calms the motions within ; and when
  - timaeus says: these are calmed, quiet ensues. And if the quiet is profound,
  - timaeus says: sleep with few dreams falls on us ; but if some of the stronger
  - timaeus says: motions are left, according to their nature and the places where
  - timaeus says: they remain, they engender visions corresponding in kind and in
  - timaeus says: number; which are images within us, and when we awake are
  - timaeus says: remembered as outside us. Now the explanation of reflections
  - timaeus says: in mirrors and all bright smooth surfaces is no longer hard to
  - timaeus says: discern. For because of the communion of the internal and
  - timaeus says: external fire, which again is united on the smooth surface and in
  - timaeus says: manifold ways deflected, all these reflections take place ; the fire
  - timaeus says: that belongs to the face coalescing with the fire of the visual
  - timaeus says: current upon the surface of the smooth bright object. And left
  - timaeus says: appears right and right left, because mutually opposite particles
  - timaeus says: of the visual current and of the object seen come into contact,
  - timaeus says: contrary to the wonted mode of collision. On the other hand right
  - timaeus says: appears as right and left as left, when in the act of combination
  - timaeus says: with that wherewith it combines the ray changes sides. This
  - timaeus says: happens when the smooth surface of the mirror is curved up-
  - timaeus says: wards on each side and so throws the right portion of the visual
  - timaeus says: current to the left side and the ccfoiverse. But if it is turned
  - timaeus says: lengthwise to the face, it makes this same reflection appear
  - timaeus says: completely upside down, thrusting the lower portion of the ray
  - timaeus says: to the upper end and the upper to the lower.

  - timaeus says: All these things are among the secondary causes which God
  - timaeus says: uses to serve him in carrying out the idea of the best so far
  - timaeus says: as is possible. But the multitude regard them not as secondary
  - timaeus says: but as primary causes, which act by cooling and heating, con-
  - timaeus says: densing and rarefying, and all such processes. Yet they are
  - timaeus says: incapable of all reason or thought for any purpose. For the
  - timaeus says: only existing thing to which belongs the possession of reason
  - timaeus says: we must affirm to be soul - and this is invisible, whereas fire
  - timaeus says: and water and air and earth are all visible creations. Now
  - timaeus says: the lover of reason and knowledge must first seek for the
  - timaeus says: causes which belong to the rational order ; and only in the
  - timaeus says: second place those which belong to the class of things which
  - timaeus says: are moved by others and move others in turn. This then is
  - timaeus says: what we must also do - we must declare both classes of causes,
  - timaeus says: distinguishing between those which with the aid of reason are
  - timaeus says: the creators of fair things and good, and those which being
  - timaeus says: destitute of reason produce from time to time chance effects
  - timaeus says: without design. Enough then of the auxiliary causes which
  - timaeus says: combine in giving the eyes the power they now possess ; but
  - timaeus says: the great result, for the sake of which God bestowed them on
  - timaeus says: us, must be our next theme. Sight, according to my judgment,
  - timaeus says: has been the cause of the greatest blessing to us, inasmuch
  - timaeus says: as of our present discourse concerning the universe not one
  - timaeus says: word would have been uttered had we never seen the stars and
  - timaeus says: the sun and the heavens. But now day and night, being seen
  - timaeus says: of us, and months and the revolution of the years have created
  - timaeus says: number, and they gave us the notion of time and the power of
  - timaeus says: searching into the nature of the All ; whence we have derived
  - timaeus says: philosophy, than which no greater good has come neither shall
  - timaeus says: come hereafter as the gift of heaven to mortal man. This I
  - timaeus says: declare to be the chiefest blessing due to the eyes - on the rest
  - timaeus says: that are meaner why should we descant ? let him who loves not
  - timaeus says: wisdom, if he be blinded of these, lament with idle moan. But
  - timaeus says: on our part let this be affirmed to be the cause of vision, for
  - timaeus says: these ends - God discovered and bestowed sight upon us in
  - timaeus says: order that we might observe the orbits of reason which are
  - timaeus says: in heaven and make use of them for the revolutions of thought
  - timaeus says: in our own souls, which are akin to them, the troubled to the
  - timaeus says: serene; and that learning them and acquiring natural truth
  - timaeus says: of reasoning we might imitate the divine movements that are
  - timaeus says: ever unerring and bring into order those within us which are
  - timaeus says: all astray. And of sound and hearing again the same account
  - timaeus says: must be given - to the same ends and with the same intent
  - timaeus says: they have been bestowed on us by the gods. For not only
  - timaeus says: has speech been appointed for this same purpose, whereto it
  - timaeus says: contributes the largest share, but all such music as is expressed
  - timaeus says: in sound has been granted, for the sake of harmony - and
  - timaeus says: harmony, having her motions akin to the revolutions in our
  - timaeus says: own souls, has been bestowed by the Muses on him who with
  - timaeus says: reason seeks their help, not for any senseless pleasure, such
  - timaeus says: as is now supposed to be its chiefest use, but as an ally against
  - timaeus says: the discord which has grown up in the revolution of our soul,
  - timaeus says: to bring her into order and into unison with herself- and
  - timaeus says: rhythm too, because our habit of mind is mostly so faulty
  - timaeus says: of measure and lacking in grace, is a succour bestowed on us
  - timaeus says: by the same givers for the same ends.

  - timaeus says: Now in our foregoing discourse, with few exceptions,
  - timaeus says: we have been declaring the creations wrought through mind -
  - timaeus says: we must now set by their side those things which come into
  - timaeus says: being through necessity. For the generation of this universe
  - timaeus says: was a mixed creation by a combination of necessity and reason.
  - timaeus says: And whereas reason governed necessity, by persuading her
  - timaeus says: to guide the greatest part of created things to the best end,
  - timaeus says: on such conditions and principles, through necessity overcome
  - timaeus says: by reasonable persuasion, this universe was fashioned in the
  - timaeus says: beginning. If then we would really declare its creation in
  - timaeus says: the manner whereby it has come to be, we must add also the
  - timaeus says: nature of the Errant Cause, and its moving power. Thus then
  - timaeus says: let us return upon our steps, and when we have found a second
  - timaeus says: fitting cause for the things aforesaid, let us once more, pro-
  - timaeus says: ceeding in the present case as we did in the former, begin over
  - timaeus says: again from the beginning. Now we must examine what came
  - timaeus says: before the creation of the heavens, the very origin of fire and
  - timaeus says: water and air and earth, and the conditions that were before
  - timaeus says: them. For now no one has declared the manner of their
  - timaeus says: generation ; but we speak as if men knew what is fire and
  - timaeus says: each of the others, and we treat them as beginnings, as elements
  - timaeus says: of the whole ; whereas by one who has ever so little intelligence
  - timaeus says: they could not plausibly be represented as belonging even to
  - timaeus says: the class of syllables. Now however let our say thus be said.
  - timaeus says: The first principle or principles or whatever we may hold it
  - timaeus says: to be which underlies all things we must not declare at present,
  - timaeus says: for no other reason but that it is difficult according to the
  - timaeus says: present method of our exposition to make clear our opinion.
  - timaeus says: You must not then deem that I ought to discourse of this,
  - timaeus says: nor could I persuade myself that I should be right in essaying
  - timaeus says: so mighty a task. But holding fast the principle we laid down
  - timaeus says: at the outset, the value of a probable account, I will strive to
  - timaeus says: give an explanation that is no less probable than another, but
  - timaeus says: more so ; returning back to describe from the beginning each
  - timaeus says: and all things. So now again at the outset of our quest let
  - timaeus says: us call upon God to pilot us safe through a strange and un-
  - timaeus says: familiar discourse to the haven of probability ; and thus let
  - timaeus says: us begin once more.

  - timaeus says: Our new exposition of the universe then must be
  - timaeus says: founded on a fuller classification than the former. Then we
  - timaeus says: distinguished two forms, but now a third kind must be disclosed.
  - timaeus says: The two were indeed enough for our former discussion, when
  - timaeus says: we laid down one form as the pattern, intelligible and change-
  - timaeus says: less, the second as a copy of the pattern, which comes into
  - timaeus says: being and is visible. A third we did not then distinguish,
  - timaeus says: deeming that the two would suffice - but now, it seems, by
  - timaeus says: constraint of our discourse we must try to express and make
  - timaeus says: manifest a form obscure and dim. What power then must we
  - timaeus says: conceive that nature has given it ? something like this. It is
  - timaeus says: the receptacle, and as it were the nurse, of all becoming. This
  - timaeus says: saying is true, but we must put it in clearer language - and this
  - timaeus says: is hard ; especially as for the sake of it we must needs inquire
  - timaeus says: into fire and the substances that rank with fire. For it is hard
  - timaeus says: to say which of all these we ought to call water any more than
  - timaeus says: fire, or indeed which we ought to call by any given name,
  - timaeus says: rather than all and each severally, in such a way as to employ
  - timaeus says: any truthful and trustworthy mode of speech. How then are we
  - timaeus says: to deal with this point, and what is the question that we should
  - timaeus says: properly raise concerning it ? In the first place, what we now have
  - timaeus says: named water, by condensation, as we suppose, we see turning
  - timaeus says: to stones and earth ; and by rarefying and expanding this same
  - timaeus says: element becomes wind and air ; and air when inflamed becomes
  - timaeus says: fire - and conversely fire contracted and quenched returns again
  - timaeus says: to the form of air; also air concentrating and condensing
  - timaeus says: becomes cloud and mist ; and from these yet further com-
  - timaeus says: pressed comes flowing water ; and from water earth and stones
  - timaeus says: once more - and so, it appears, they hand on one to another
  - timaeus says: the cycle of generation. Thus then since these several bodies
  - timaeus says: never assume one constant form, which of them can we posi-
  - timaeus says: tively affirm to be really this and not another without being
  - timaeus says: shamed in our own eyes ? It cannot be - it is far the safest
  - timaeus says: course when we make a statement concerning them to speak
  - timaeus says: as follows. What we see in process of perpetual transmutation,
  - timaeus says: as for instance fire, we must not call this, but such-tike is the
  - timaeus says: appellation we must confer on fire ; nor must we call water
  - timaeus says: this, but always such; nor must we apply to anything, as if
  - timaeus says: it had any stability, such predicates as we express by the
  - timaeus says: use of the terms this and that and suppose that we signify
  - timaeus says: something thereby. For it flees and will not abide such
  - timaeus says: terms as this and that and relative to this, and every phrase
  - timaeus says: which represents it as stable. The word this we must not
  - timaeus says: use of any of them; but such, applying in the same sense to
  - timaeus says: all their mutations, we must predicate of each and all - fire we
  - timaeus says: must call that which universally has that appearance ; and so
  - timaeus says: must we name all things such as come into being. That
  - timaeus says: wherein they come to be severally and show themselves, and
  - timaeus says: from whence again they perish, in naming that alone must
  - timaeus says: we use the words that and this; but whatever has any quality,
  - timaeus says: such as white or hot or any of two opposite attributes, and all
  - timaeus says: combinations of these, we must denote by no such term.

  - timaeus says: But we must try to speak yet more clearly on this matter.
  - timaeus says: Suppose a man having moulded all kinds of figures out of
  - timaeus says: gold should unceasingly remould them, interchanging them
  - timaeus says: all with one another, it were much the safest thing in view
  - timaeus says: of truth to say that it is gold ; but as to the triangles or any
  - timaeus says: other shapes that were impressed on it, never to speak of
  - timaeus says: them as existing, seeing that they change even as we are in
  - timaeus says: the act of defining them ; but if it will admit the term such with
  - timaeus says: any tolerable security, we must be content. The same lan-
  - timaeus says: guage must be applied to the nature which receives into it
  - timaeus says: all material things - we must call it always the same ; for it
  - timaeus says: never departs from its own function at all. It ever receives
  - timaeus says: all things into it and has nowhere any form in any wise like
  - timaeus says: to aught of the shapes that enter into it. For it is as the
  - timaeus says: substance wherein all things are naturally moulded, being
  - timaeus says: stirred and informed by the entering shapes ; and owing to
  - timaeus says: them it appears different from time to time. But the shapes
  - timaeus says: which pass in and out are likenesses of the eternal existences,
  - timaeus says: being copied from them in a fashion wondrous and hard to
  - timaeus says: declare, which we will follow up later on. For the present how-
  - timaeus says: ever we must conceive three kinds - first that which comes
  - timaeus says: to be, secondly that wherein it comes to be, third that from
  - timaeus says: which the becoming is copied when it is created. And we
  - timaeus says: may liken the recipient to a mother, the model to a father,
  - timaeus says: and that which is between them to a child ; and we must
  - timaeus says: remember that if a moulded copy is to present to view
  - timaeus says: all varieties of form, the matter in which it is moulded cannot
  - timaeus says: be rightly prepared unless it be entirely bereft of all those
  - timaeus says: forms which it is about to receive from without. For were
  - timaeus says: it like any one of the entering shapes, whenever that of an op-
  - timaeus says: posite or entirely different nature came upon it, it would in
  - timaeus says: receiving it give the impression badly, intruding its own form.
  - timaeus says: Wherefore that which shall receive all forms within itself must
  - timaeus says: be utterly without share in any of the forms ; just as in the
  - timaeus says: making of sweet unguents, men purposely contrive, as the
  - timaeus says: beginning of the work, to make the fluids that are to receive
  - timaeus says: the perfumes perfectly scentless - and those who set about
  - timaeus says: moulding figures in any soft substance do not suffer any shape
  - timaeus says: to show itself therein at the beginning, but they first knead it
  - timaeus says: smooth and make it as uniform as they can. In the same way
  - timaeus says: it behoves that which is fitly to receive many times over its
  - timaeus says: whole extent likenesses of all things, that is of all eternal ex-
  - timaeus says: istences, to be itself naturally without part or lot in any of the
  - timaeus says: forms. Therefore the mother and recipient of creation which is
  - timaeus says: visible and by any sense perceptible we must call neither earth
  - timaeus says: nor air nor fire nor water, nor the combinations of these nor the
  - timaeus says: elements of which they are formed - but we shall not err in
  - timaeus says: affirming it to be a viewless nature and formless, all-receiving,
  - timaeus says: in some manner most bewildering and hard to comprehend par-
  - timaeus says: taking of the intelligible. But so far as from what has been said
  - timaeus says: we may arrive at its nature, this would be the most just account
  - timaeus says: of it. That part of it which is enkindled from time to time
  - timaeus says: appears as fire, and that which is made liquid as water, and as
  - timaeus says: earth and air such part of it as receives the likenesses of these.

  - timaeus says: But in our inquiry concerning these we must deliver a
  - timaeus says: stricter statement. Is there an absolute idea of fire, and do all
  - timaeus says: those absolute ideas exist to which in every case we always
  - timaeus says: ascribe absolute being ? Or do those things which we actually
  - timaeus says: see or perceive with any other bodily sense alone possess such
  - timaeus says: reality ? and is it true that there are no manner of real existences
  - timaeus says: beyond these at all, but we talk idly when we speak of an in-
  - timaeus says: telligible idea as actually existent, whereas it was nothing but a
  - timaeus says: conception ? Now it does not become us either to dismiss the
  - timaeus says: present question unjudged and undecided, simply asserting that
  - timaeus says: the ideas exist, nor yet must we add to our already long dis-
  - timaeus says: course another as long which is subordinate. But if we could
  - timaeus says: see our way to a great definition couched in brief words, that
  - timaeus says: would be most seasonable for our present purpose. Thus then
  - timaeus says: do I give my own verdict - if reason and true opinion are of two
  - timaeus says: different kinds, then the ideas do surely exist, forms not per-
  - timaeus says: ceptible by our senses, the objects of thought alone ; but if, as
  - timaeus says: some hold, true opinion differs nothing from reason, then all
  - timaeus says: that we apprehend by our bodily organs we must affirm to be
  - timaeus says: the most real existence. Now we must declare them to be two,
  - timaeus says: because they are different in origin and unlike in nature. The
  - timaeus says: one is engendered in us by instruction, the other by persuasion ;
  - timaeus says: the one is ever accompanied by right understanding, the other is
  - timaeus says: without understanding; the one is not to be moved by per-
  - timaeus says: suasion, the other yields to persuasion ; true opinion we must
  - timaeus says: admit is shared by all men, but reason by the gods alone and a
  - timaeus says: very small portion of mankind. This being so, we must agree
  - timaeus says: that there is first the unchanging idea, unbegotten and imperish-
  - timaeus says: able, neither receiving aught into itself from without nor itself
  - timaeus says: entering into aught else, invisible, nor in any wise perceptible
  - timaeus says: even that whereof the contemplation belongs to thought. Second
  - timaeus says: is that which is named after it and is like to it, sensible, created,
  - timaeus says: ever in motion, coming to be in a certain place and again from
  - timaeus says: thence perishing, apprehensible by opinion with sensation. And
  - timaeus says: the third kind is space everlasting, admitting not destruction, but
  - timaeus says: affording place for all things that come into being, itself appre-
  - timaeus says: hensible without sensation by a sort of bastard reasoning, hardly
  - timaeus says: matter of belief. It is with this in view that dreaming we say
  - timaeus says: that all which exists must be in some place and rilling some
  - timaeus says: space, and that what is neither on earth nor in heaven anywhere
  - timaeus says: is nought. All these and many kindred fancies have we even
  - timaeus says: concerning that unsleeping essence and truly existing, for that
  - timaeus says: by reason of this dreaming state we become impotent to arouse
  - timaeus says: ourselves and affirm the truth ; namely, that to an image it
  - timaeus says: belongs, seeing that it is not the very model of itself, on which
  - timaeus says: itself has been created, but is ever the fleeting semblance of
  - timaeus says: another, in another to come into being, clinging to existence as
  - timaeus says: best it may, on pain of being nothing at all ; but to the really
  - timaeus says: existent essence reason in all exactness true comes as an ally,
  - timaeus says: declaring that so long as one thing is one and another thing
  - timaeus says: is other, neither of them shall come to be in the other, so that
  - timaeus says: the same becomes at once one and two.

  - timaeus says: Such then is the statement for which I give my
  - timaeus says: sentence, as we have briefly reasoned it out- that there are
  - timaeus says: Being and Space and Becoming, three in number with threefold
  - timaeus says: nature, even before the heavens were created. And the nurse
  - timaeus says: of becoming, being made liquid and fiery and putting on the
  - timaeus says: forms of earth and air, and undergoing all the conditions that
  - timaeus says: attend thereupon, displays to view all manner of semblances ;
  - timaeus says: and because she is filled with powers that are not similar nor
  - timaeus says: equivalent, she is at no part of her in even balance, but being
  - timaeus says: swayed in all directions unevenly, she is herself shaken by the
  - timaeus says: entering forms, and by her motion shakes them again in turn -
  - timaeus says: and they, being thus stirred, are carried in different directions

  - timaeus says: by the recipient, which by the motion she has received acts as
  - timaeus says: an instrument for shaking, she separates the most dissimilar
  - timaeus says: elements furthest apart from one another, and the most similar
  - timaeus says: she draws chiefly together ; for which cause these elements had
  - timaeus says: different regions even before the universe was ordered out of
  - timaeus says: them and created. Before that came to pass all these things
  - timaeus says: were without method or measure ; but when an essay was being
  - timaeus says: made to order the universe, first fire and water and earth and air,
  - timaeus says: which had certain vestiges of their own nature, yet were alto-
  - timaeus says: gether in such a condition as we should expect for everything
  - timaeus says: when God is not in it, being by nature in the state we have said,
  - timaeus says: were then first by the creator fashioned forth with forms and
  - timaeus says: numbers. And that God formed them to be most fair and perfect,
  - timaeus says: not having been so heretofore, must above all things be the
  - timaeus says: foundation whereon our account is for ever based. But now the
  - timaeus says: disposition of each and their generation is what I must strive to
  - timaeus says: make known to you in speech unwonted - but seeing ye are no
  - timaeus says: strangers to the paths of learning, through which my sayings

  - timaeus says: In the first place, that fire and earth and water and air
  - timaeus says: are material bodies is evident to all. Every form of body has
  - timaeus says: depth- and depth must be bounded by plane surfaces. Now
  - timaeus says: every rectilinear plane is composed of triangles. And all
  - timaeus says: triangles are derived from two triangles, each having one right
  - timaeus says: angle and the others acute- and one triangle has on each side a
  - timaeus says: moiety of a right angle marked off by equal sides, the other
  - timaeus says: has it divided into unequal parts by unequal sides. These
  - timaeus says: we conceive to be the basis of fire and the other bodies, follow-
  - timaeus says: ing up the probable account which is concerned with necessity-
  - timaeus says: but the principles yet more remote than these are known but to
  - timaeus says: God and to whatsoever man is a friend of God. Now we must
  - timaeus says: declare what are the four fairest bodies that could be created,
  - timaeus says: unlike one another, but capable, some of them, of being gene-
  - timaeus says: rated out of each other by their dissolution - for if we succeed in
  - timaeus says: this, we have come at the truth concerning earth and fire
  - timaeus says: and the intermediate proportionals. For we will concede to
  - timaeus says: no one that there exist any visible bodies fairer than these, each
  - timaeus says: after its own kind. We must do our diligence then to put
  - timaeus says: together these four kinds of bodies most excellent in beauty,
  - timaeus says: and so we shall say that we have a full comprehension of their
  - timaeus says: nature.
  - show timaeus: AT CENTER

  - timaeus says: Now of the two triangles the isosceles has but one kind,
  - timaeus says: but the scalene an endless number. Out of this infinite multi-
  - timaeus says: tude then we must choose the fairest, if we are to begin upon
  - timaeus says: our own principles. If then any man can tell of a fairer kind
  - timaeus says: that he has selected for the composition of these bodies, it
  - timaeus says: is no enemy but a friend who vanquishes us - however of
  - timaeus says: all these triangles we declare one to be the fairest, passing
  - timaeus says: over the rest; that namely of which two conjoined form an
  - timaeus says: equilateral triangle. The reason it were too long to tell - but if
  - timaeus says: any man convict us in this and find that it is not so, the
  - timaeus says: palm is ready for him with our right good will. Let then
  - timaeus says: two triangles be chosen whereof the substance of fire and of the
  - timaeus says: other elements has been wrought ; the one isosceles, the other
  - timaeus says: always having the square on the greater side three times
  - timaeus says: the square on the lesser. And now we must more strictly define
  - timaeus says: something which we expressed not quite clearly enough before.
  - timaeus says: For it appeared as though all the four classes had generation
  - timaeus says: through each other and into each other, but this appearance was
  - timaeus says: delusive. For out of the triangles we have chosen arise four
  - timaeus says: kinds, three from one of them, that which has unequal sides,
  - timaeus says: and the fourth one alone composed of the isosceles triangle. It
  - timaeus says: is not then possible for all of them by dissolution to pass
  - timaeus says: one into another, a few large bodies being formed of many
  - timaeus says: small, and the converse- but for three of them it is possible.
  - show timaeus: AT CENTER
  - show timaeus: talk AT CENTER
  - timaeus says: For since they all arise from one basis, when the larger bodies
  - timaeus says: are broken up, a number of small ones will be formed from
  - timaeus says: the same elements, putting on the shapes proper to them;
  - timaeus says: and again when a number of small bodies are resolved into
  - timaeus says: their triangles, they will become one in number and constitute a
  - timaeus says: single large body of a different form. So much for their gene-
  - timaeus says: ration into one another - the next thing will be to say what
  - timaeus says: is the form in which each has been created, and by the com-
  - timaeus says: bination of what numbers. We will begin with the form which
  - timaeus says: is simplest and smallest in its construction. Its element is the
  - timaeus says: triangle which has the hypotenuse double of the shorter side
  - timaeus says: in length. If a pair of these are put together so that their
  - timaeus says: hypotenuses coincide, and this is done three times, in such
  - timaeus says: a way that the hypotenuses and the shorter sides meet in
  - timaeus says: one point as a centre, thus one equilateral triangle has been
  - timaeus says: formed out of the other six triangles- and if four equilateral
  - timaeus says: triangles are combined, so that three plane angles meet in
  - timaeus says: a point, they make at each point one solid angle, that which
  - timaeus says: comes immediately next to the most obtuse of plane angles;
  - timaeus says: and when four such angles are produced there is formed the first
  - timaeus says: solid figure, dividing its whole surface into four equal and similar
  - timaeus says: parts. The second is formed of the same triangles in sets of
  - timaeus says: eight equilateral triangles, bounding every single solid angle by
  - timaeus says: four planes ; and with the formation of six such solid angles the
  - timaeus says: second figure is also complete. The third is composed of 120
  - timaeus says: of the elementary triangles united, and of twelve solid angles,
  - timaeus says: each contained by five plane equilateral triangles ; and it has
  - timaeus says: twenty equilateral surfaces. And the first element, when it had
  - timaeus says: generated these figures, had done its part - the isosceles triangle
  - timaeus says: generated the fourth, combined in sets of four, with the right
  - timaeus says: angles meeting at the centre, thus forming a single square. Six
  - timaeus says: of these squares joined together formed eight solid angles, each
  - timaeus says: produced by three plane right angles - and the shape of the
  - timaeus says: body thus formed was cubical, having six square planes for its
  - timaeus says: surfaces. And whereas a fifth figure yet alone remained, God
  - timaeus says: used it for the universe in embellishing it with signs.

  - timaeus says: Now if any man, reflecting upon all these things,
  - timaeus says: should fairly ask himself whether the number of cosmic systems
  - timaeus says: is indefinite or definite, he would deem that to believe them in-
  - timaeus says: definite was the opinion of one who thought very indefinitely on
  - timaeus says: a matter where he ought to be most definitely informed - but
  - timaeus says: whether we ought to say that there is but one, or that there are
  - timaeus says: really in nature five, he might, if he stopped short there, with
  - timaeus says: more justice feel doubtful. Our verdict declares that according
  - timaeus says: to the probable theory it is by nature one ; another however,
  - timaeus says: looking to some other guide, may have a different view. But
  - timaeus says: no more of him ; let us assign the figures that have come into
  - timaeus says: being in our theory to fire and earth and water and air. To
  - timaeus says: earth let us give the cubical form ; for earth is least mobile
  - timaeus says: of the four and most plastic of bodies - and that substance must
  - timaeus says: possess this nature in the highest degree which has its bases
  - timaeus says: most stable. Now of the triangles which we assumed as our
  - timaeus says: starting-point that with equal sides is more stable than that
  - timaeus says: with unequal ; and of the surfaces composed of the two triangles
  - timaeus says: the equilateral quadrangle necessarily is more stable than the
  - timaeus says: equilateral triangle, both in its parts and as a whole. There-
  - timaeus says: fore in assigning this to earth we preserve the probability of our
  - timaeus says: account ; and also in giving to water the least mobile and to fire
  - timaeus says: the most mobile of those which remain ; while to air we give
  - timaeus says: that which is intermediate. Again we shall assign the smallest
  - timaeus says: figure to fire, and the largest to water and the intermediate to
  - timaeus says: air- and the keenest to fire, the next to air, and the third to
  - timaeus says: water. Now among all these that which has the fewest bases
  - timaeus says: must naturally in all respects be the most cutting and keen of
  - timaeus says: all, and also the most nimble, seeing it is composed of the small-
  - timaeus says: est number of similar parts; and the second must have these
  - timaeus says: same qualities in the second degree, and the third in the third
  - timaeus says: degree. Let it be determined then, according to the right ac-
  - timaeus says: count and the probable, that the solid body which has taken
  - timaeus says: the form of the pyramid is the element and seed of fire ; and
  - timaeus says: the second in order of generation let us say to be that of air, and
  - timaeus says: the third that of water. Now all these bodies we must conceive
  - timaeus says: as being so small that each single body in the several kinds
  - timaeus says: cannot for its smallness be seen by us at all ; but when many
  - timaeus says: are heaped together, their united mass is seen - and we must
  - timaeus says: suppose that the due proportion in respect of their multitude
  - timaeus says: and motions and all their other powers, when God had com-
  - timaeus says: pleted them with all perfection, in so far as the nature of neces-
  - timaeus says: sity, consenting and yielding to persuasion, suffered, were every-
  - timaeus says: where by him ordained in fitting measure.

  - timaeus says: From all that we have already said in the matter of
  - timaeus says: these four kinds, the facts would seem to be as follows. When
  - timaeus says: earth meets with fire and is dissolved by the keenness of it, it
  - timaeus says: would drift about, whether it were dissolved in fire itself, or in
  - timaeus says: some mass of air or water, until the parts of it meeting and again
  - timaeus says: being united became earth once more ; for it never could pass
  - timaeus says: into any other kind. But when water is divided by fire or by
  - timaeus says: air, it may be formed again and become one particle of fire and
  - timaeus says: two of air - and the divisions of air may become for every particle
  - timaeus says: broken up two particles of fire. And again when fire is caught
  - timaeus says: in air or in waters or in earth, a little in a great bulk, moving
  - timaeus says: amid a rushing body, and contending with it is vanquished and
  - timaeus says: broken up, two particles of fire combine into one figure of
  - timaeus says: air- and when air is vanquished and broken small, from two
  - timaeus says: whole and one half particle one whole figure of water will be
  - timaeus says: composed. Let us also reckon it once again thus - when any
  - timaeus says: of the other kinds is intercepted in fire and is divided by it
  - timaeus says: through the sharpness of its angles and its sides, if it forms into
  - timaeus says: the shape of fire, it at once ceases from being divided - for a
  - timaeus says: kind which is uniform and identical, of whatever sort it be, can
  - timaeus says: neither be the cause of any change nor can it suffer any from
  - timaeus says: that which is identical and uniform with itself; but so long as
  - timaeus says: passing into another kind a lesser bulk contends with the
  - timaeus says: greater, it ceases never from being broken. And when the
  - timaeus says: smaller figures few in number are caught in a multitude of
  - timaeus says: larger figures and are being broken in pieces and quenched, if
  - timaeus says: they consent to combine into the form of the stronger they
  - timaeus says: then and there cease from being quenched ; and from fire arises
  - timaeus says: air, from air water. But if they assail the others, and another
  - timaeus says: sort meet and contend with them, they cease not from being
  - timaeus says: shattered until, being entirely repelled and dissolved, they find
  - timaeus says: refuge with some of their own kind, or being overcome, form
  - timaeus says: from many of their own figures one similar to the victorious
  - timaeus says: element, and there remain and abide with it. Moreover on
  - timaeus says: account of these conditions they all are changing their places ;
  - timaeus says: for the bulk of every kind are sorted into separate regions of
  - timaeus says: their own through the motion of the recipient - and those which
  - timaeus says: are altered from their own nature and made like some other
  - timaeus says: are carried by reason of this movement to the region proper to
  - timaeus says: the element to which they are assimilated.

  - timaeus says: All unmixed and primary bodies have thus come into being
  - timaeus says: through the causes we have described - but for the fact that
  - timaeus says: within the several classes different kinds exist we must assign as
  - timaeus says: its cause the structure of the elementary triangles ; it does not
  - timaeus says: originally produce in each kind of triangle one and the same
  - timaeus says: size only, but some greater and some less ; and there are just so
  - timaeus says: many sizes as there are kinds in the classes - and when these
  - timaeus says: are mixed up with themselves or with one another, an endless
  - timaeus says: diversity arises, which must be examined by those who would
  - timaeus says: put forward a probable theory concerning nature.

  - timaeus says: Now concerning rest and motion, how they arise
  - timaeus says: and under what conditions, we must come to an agreement, else
  - timaeus says: many difficulties will stand in the way of our argument that is
  - timaeus says: to follow. This has been already in part set forth, but we have
  - timaeus says: yet to add that in uniformity no movement will ever exist. For
  - timaeus says: that what is to be moved should exist without that which is to
  - timaeus says: move it, or what is to move without that which is to be moved,
  - timaeus says: is difficult or rather impossible - but without these there can be
  - timaeus says: no motion, and for these to be uniform is not possible. So
  - timaeus says: then let us always assign rest to uniformity and motion to its
  - timaeus says: opposite. Now the opposite of uniformity is caused by in-
  - timaeus says: equality ; and of inequality we have discussed the origin. But
  - timaeus says: how it comes to pass that all bodies are not sorted off into
  - timaeus says: their several kinds and cease from passing through one another
  - timaeus says: and changing their place, this we have not explained. Let us
  - timaeus says: put it again in this way. The revolution of the whole, when it
  - timaeus says: had embraced the four kinds, being circular, with a natural
  - timaeus says: tendency to return upon itself, compresses everything and suffers
  - timaeus says: no vacant space to be left. Therefore fire penetrates most of
  - timaeus says: all through all things, and in the second degree air, since it is
  - timaeus says: second in fineness, and the rest in proportion. For the sub-
  - timaeus says: stances which are formed of the largest parts have the most
  - timaeus says: void left in their structure, and those made of the smallest have
  - timaeus says: the least. Now the constriction of this contracting force thrusts
  - timaeus says: the small particles into the interspaces between the larger - so
  - timaeus says: that when small are set side by side with great, and the lesser
  - timaeus says: particles divide the greater, while the greater compress the
  - timaeus says: smaller, all things keep rushing backwards and forwards to their
  - timaeus says: own region; since in changing its bulk each changes its proper
  - timaeus says: position in space. Thus owing to these causes a perpetual dis-
  - timaeus says: turbance of uniformity is always kept up and so preserves the
  - timaeus says: perpetual motion of matter now and henceforth without cessation.

  - timaeus says: Next we must remember that of fire there are many
  - timaeus says: kinds- for instance flame and that effluence from flame, which
  - timaeus says: burns not but gives light to the eyes, and that which remains in
  - timaeus says: the embers when the flame is out And so with air - the purest
  - timaeus says: is that which is called by the name of aether, and the most
  - timaeus says: turbid is mist and gloom ; and there are other kinds which have
  - timaeus says: no name, arising from the inequality of the triangles. Of water
  - timaeus says: there are two primary divisions, the liquid and the fusible kind.
  - timaeus says: The liquid sort owes its nature to possessing the smaller kinds
  - timaeus says: of watery atoms, unequal in size ; and so it can readily either
  - timaeus says: move of itself or be moved by something else, owing to its lack
  - timaeus says: of uniformity and the peculiar shape of its atoms. But that
  - timaeus says: which consists of larger and uniform particles is more stable
  - timaeus says: than the former and heavy, being stiffened by its uniformity-
  - timaeus says: but when fire enters into it and breaks it up, it loses its uni-
  - timaeus says: formity and gains more power of motion - and as soon as it has
  - timaeus says: become mobile, it is thrust by the surrounding air and spread
  - timaeus says: out upon the earth- and it has received names descriptive of
  - timaeus says: either process, melting of the dissolution of the mass, flowing
  - timaeus says: of the extension on the ground. But when the fire goes forth
  - timaeus says: from it again, seeing that it does not issue into empty space, the
  - timaeus says: neighbouring air receives a thrust, and while the liquid mass is
  - timaeus says: still mobile, it forces it to fill up the vacant places of the fire and
  - timaeus says: unites it with itself. And being thus compressed and recovering
  - timaeus says: its uniformity, seeing that fire the creator of inequality is
  - timaeus says: quitting it, it settles into its normal state. And the departure of
  - timaeus says: fire we call cooling, and the contraction that ensues on its with-
  - timaeus says: drawal we class as solidification. Of all the substances which
  - timaeus says: we have ranked as fusible kinds of water, that which is densest
  - timaeus says: and formed of the finest and most uniform particles, a unique
  - timaeus says: kind, combining brightness with a yellow hue, is gold, a most
  - timaeus says: precious treasure, which has filtered through rocks and there
  - timaeus says: congealed - and the ' offspring of gold ', which is extremely hard
  - timaeus says: owing to its density and has turned black, is called adamant.
  - timaeus says: Another has particles resembling those of gold, but more than
  - timaeus says: one kind; in density it even surpasses gold and has a small
  - timaeus says: admixture of fine earth, so that it is harder, but lighter, because
  - timaeus says: it has large interstices within ; this formation is one of the
  - timaeus says: shining and solid kinds of water and is called bronze. The
  - timaeus says: earth which is mingled with it, when the two through age begin
  - timaeus says: to separate again, becomes visible by itself and is named rust.
  - timaeus says: And it were no intricate task to explain all the other substances
  - timaeus says: of this kind, following the outline of our probable account.
  - timaeus says: For if we pursue this as a recreation, and while laying down the
  - timaeus says: principles of eternal being find in plausible theories of becoming
  - timaeus says: a pleasure that brings no remorse in its train, we may draw from
  - timaeus says: it a sober and sensible amusement during our life. Now there-
  - timaeus says: fore setting out in this way let us go on to discuss the proba-
  - timaeus says: bilities that lie next on the same subject.

  - timaeus says: Water mingled with fire, such as is rare and liquid (owing to
  - timaeus says: its mobility and its way of rolling along the ground, which gets
  - timaeus says: it the name of liquid), and is also soft, because its bases give way,
  - timaeus says: being less stable than those of earth, when relinquished by fire
  - timaeus says: and deserted of air, becomes more uniform and is compressed
  - timaeus says: by the outgoing elements ; thus it is congealed, and when above
  - timaeus says: the earth this process takes place in an extreme degree, the result
  - timaeus says: is hail ; if upon the earth, it is ice - but when the process has not
  - timaeus says: gone so far but leaves it half-congealed, above the earth it is snow,
  - timaeus says: and when congealed from dew upon the earth, it is called hoar-
  - timaeus says: frost. Most forms of water, which are intermingled with one
  - timaeus says: another, filtered through the plants of the earth, are called by the
  - timaeus says: class-name of saps ; but owing to their intermixture they are all of
  - timaeus says: diverse natures and the great multitude of them are accordingly
  - timaeus says: unnamed - four kinds however which are of a fiery nature, being
  - timaeus says: more conspicuous, have obtained names - one that heats the soul
  - timaeus says: and body together, namely wine ; next a kind which is smooth
  - timaeus says: and divides the visual current and therefore appears bright and
  - timaeus says: shining to view and glistening, I mean the class of oils, resin
  - timaeus says: and castor oil and olive oil itself and all others that have the
  - timaeus says: same properties ; thirdly that which expands the contracted
  - timaeus says: pores of the mouth to their natural condition, and by this
  - timaeus says: property produces sweetness to the taste, of this honey is the
  - timaeus says: most general appellation ; lastly that which corrodes the flesh
  - timaeus says: by burning, a sort of frothy substance, distinct from all the other
  - timaeus says: saps, which has been named verjuice.

  - timaeus says: Of the different kinds of earth, that which is strained
  - timaeus says: through water becomes a stony mass in the following way.
  - timaeus says: When the commingled water is broken up in the mixing, it
  - timaeus says: changes into the form of air ; and having become air it darts up
  - timaeus says: to its own region. Now there was no void surrounding it ; ac-
  - timaeus says: cordingly it gives a thrust to the neighbouring air. And the air,
  - timaeus says: being weighty, when it is thrust and poured around the mass of
  - timaeus says: earth, presses it hard and squeezes it into the spaces which the
  - timaeus says: new-made air quitted. Thus earth, when compressed by air
  - timaeus says: into a mass that will not dissolve in water, forms stone ; of
  - timaeus says: which the transparent sort made of equal and uniform particles
  - timaeus says: is fairer, while that of the opposite kind is less fair. But that
  - timaeus says: which is suddenly deprived of all its moisture by the rapid
  - timaeus says: action of fire and is become more brittle than the first forms
  - timaeus says: the class to which we have given the name of earthenware.
  - timaeus says: Again when some moisture is left behind, earth, after having
  - timaeus says: been fused by fire and again cooled, becomes a certain stone
  - timaeus says: of a black colour. There are also two sorts which in the
  - timaeus says: same manner after the admixture are robbed of a great part
  - timaeus says: of the water, being formed of the finer particles of earth with
  - timaeus says: a saline taste, and becoming only half solid and soluble
  - timaeus says: again by water; of these what purifies from oil and earth is
  - timaeus says: alkali ; while that which easily blends with all the combinations
  - timaeus says: of tastes on the palate is, in the words of the ordinance, the god-
  - timaeus says: beloved substance of salt. The bodies which are composed of
  - timaeus says: earth and water combined cannot be dissolved by water, but
  - timaeus says: by fire alone for the following reason. A mass of earth is
  - timaeus says: resolved neither by fire nor by air, because their atoms are
  - timaeus says: smaller than the interstices in its structure, so that they have
  - timaeus says: abundant room to move in and do not force their way, wherefore
  - timaeus says: instead of breaking it up they leave it undissolved - but whereas
  - timaeus says: the parts of water are larger, they make their passage by force
  - timaeus says: and dissolve the mass by breaking it up. Earth then, when it
  - timaeus says: is not forcibly solidified, is thus dissolved by water only; but
  - timaeus says: when it is solidified, only by fire, for no entrance is left except
  - timaeus says: to fire. And of water the most forcible congelation is melted by
  - timaeus says: fire alone, but the more feeble both fire and air break up ; the
  - timaeus says: latter by the interstices, the former by the triangles as well. Air,
  - timaeus says: when forcibly condensed, can only be resolved into the ele-
  - timaeus says: mentary triangles, and when uncondensed fire alone dissolves
  - timaeus says: it. In the case of a substance formed of water and earth com-
  - timaeus says: bined, so long as water occupies the spaces in it that are
  - timaeus says: forcibly compressed, the particles of water arriving from without
  - timaeus says: find no entrance but simply flow round and leave the whole
  - timaeus says: bulk undissolved; but those of fire enter into the interstices of the
  - timaeus says: water, and acting upon it as water does upon earth, can alone
  - timaeus says: cause the combined mass to melt and become liquid. In this
  - timaeus says: class those which have less water than earth are all kinds of glass
  - timaeus says: and all stones that are called fusible; and those which contain
  - timaeus says: more water include all formations like wax and frankincense.

  - timaeus says: shapes and combinations and changes from one to another have
  - timaeus says: been pretty fully set forth; next we must try to explain their
  - timaeus says: affections and the causes that lead to them. First we must
  - timaeus says: assign to all the substances we have described the property of
  - timaeus says: causing sensation. But the origin of flesh and all that belongs
  - timaeus says: to it and of the mortal part of soul we have not yet discussed.

  - timaeus says: Now this cannot be adequately dealt with apart from the
  - timaeus says: affections of sense, nor yet can the latter without the former
  - timaeus says: yet to treat them both at once is hardly possible. We must
  - timaeus says: assume one side then, and afterwards we will return to examine
  - timaeus says: what we assumed. In order then that the properties of the
  - timaeus says: several elements may be discussed in due order, let us first as-
  - timaeus says: sume the nature of body and soul. First then let us see what
  - timaeus says: we mean by calling fire hot ; which we must consider in the
  - timaeus says: following way, remembering the power of dividing and cutting
  - timaeus says: which fire exercises upon our body. That the sensation is a
  - timaeus says: sharp one we are all well enough aware - and the fineness of
  - timaeus says: the edges and sharpness of the angles, besides the smallness
  - timaeus says: of its particles and the swiftness of its motion, all of which
  - timaeus says: qualities combine to render it so vehement and piercing as
  - timaeus says: keenly to cut whatever meets it all this we must take into
  - timaeus says: account, remembering the nature of its figure, that this more
  - timaeus says: than any other kind penetrates our body and minutely divides
  - timaeus says: it, whence the sensation that we now call heat justly derives
  - timaeus says: its quality and its name. The opposite condition, though
  - timaeus says: obvious enough, still must not lack an explanation. When
  - timaeus says: the larger particles of moisture which surround the body enter
  - timaeus says: into it, they displace the smaller, and because they are not
  - timaeus says: able to pass into their places, they compress the moisture within
  - timaeus says: us; and whereas it was irregular and mobile, they render it
  - timaeus says: immovable owing to uniformity and contraction, and so it
  - timaeus says: becomes rigid. And what is against nature contracted in
  - timaeus says: obedience to nature struggles and thrusts itself apart ; and to
  - timaeus says: this struggling and quaking has been given the name of
  - timaeus says: trembling and shivering - and both the effect and the cause
  - timaeus says: of it are in all cases termed ' cold '.

  - timaeus says: yields; and ' soft ' to those which yield to the flesh ; and so also
  - timaeus says: they are termed in their relation to each other. Those which
  - timaeus says: yield are such as have a small base of support; and the figure
  - timaeus says: with square surfaces, as it is most firmly based, is the most
  - timaeus says: stubborn form ; so too is whatever from the intensity of its com-
  - timaeus says: pression offers the strongest resistance.

  - timaeus says: Of 'heavy' and 'light' we shall find the clearest explanation
  - timaeus says: if we examine them together with the so-called 'below' and
  - timaeus says: above. That there are naturally two opposite regions, dividing
  - timaeus says: the universe between them, one the lower, to which sink all
  - timaeus says: things that have material bulk, the other upper, to which every-
  - timaeus says: thing rises against its will, is altogether a false opinion. For
  - timaeus says: since the form of the universe is spherical, all the extreme points,
  - timaeus says: being equally distant from the centre, are by their very nature
  - timaeus says: equally extreme ; and the centre, being equally distant from
  - timaeus says: all the extremes, ought to be regarded as opposite to all such
  - timaeus says: points. This being the nature of the universe, how can one
  - timaeus says: describe any of the said points as upper or lower, without justly
  - timaeus says: being censured for using irrelevant terms ? For the centre
  - timaeus says: cannot properly be described as being above or below, but
  - timaeus says: simply at the centre ; while the circumference is neither itself
  - timaeus says: central nor has any difference between the points on its sur-
  - timaeus says: face, so that one has a different relation to the centre from
  - timaeus says: an opposite point. Since then it is everywhere uniform, how
  - timaeus says: and in what sense can we suppose we are speaking correctly
  - timaeus says: if we use terms which imply opposition ? For suppose in the
  - timaeus says: midst of the universe there were a solid body in equilibrium,
  - timaeus says: it would have no tendency towards any point in the circum-
  - timaeus says: ference, owing to the absolute uniformity of the whole - indeed
  - timaeus says: if we were to walk round the sphere, frequently, as we stood
  - timaeus says: at the antipodes of our former position, we should call the
  - timaeus says: same point on its surface successively 'above' and 'below'. For
  - timaeus says: this universe being spherical, as we just now said, no rational
  - timaeus says: man can speak of one region as upper, of another as lower- how-
  - timaeus says: ever whence these names were derived and under what conditions
  - timaeus says: we use them to express this division of the entire universe,
  - timaeus says: we may explain on the following hypothesis. In that region
  - timaeus says: of the universe which is specially allotted to the element of
  - timaeus says: fire, where indeed the greatest mass would be collected of that
  - timaeus says: to which it is attracted, if one should attain to this place, and,
  - timaeus says: acquiring the needful power, should separate portions of fire
  - timaeus says: and weigh them in scales, when he raises the balance and
  - timaeus says: forcibly drags the fire into the alien air, evidently he overpowers
  - timaeus says: the smaller portion more easily than the larger - for when two
  - timaeus says: masses are raised at once by the same force, necessarily the
  - timaeus says: smaller yields more readily to the force, the larger, owing to
  - timaeus says: its resistance, less readily - hence the larger mass is said to be
  - timaeus says: heavy and to tend downwards, the smaller to be light and
  - timaeus says: to tend upwards. This is exactly what we ought to detect
  - timaeus says: ourselves doing in our own region. Moving as we do on the
  - timaeus says: earth, we separate portions of earthy substances or sometimes
  - timaeus says: earth itself, and drag them into the alien air with unnatural
  - timaeus says: force, for each portion clings to its own kind. Now the smaller
  - timaeus says: mass yields more readily to our force than the larger and follows
  - timaeus says: quicker into the alien element ; therefore we call it ' light ', and
  - timaeus says: the place into which we force it ' above ' ; while to the opposite
  - timaeus says: conditions we apply the terms 'heavy' and 'below'. Now
  - timaeus says: that these mutual relations should vary is inevitable, because
  - timaeus says: the bulk of the several elements occupy contrary positions in
  - timaeus says: space. For as between a body that is light in one region and
  - timaeus says: a body that is light in the opposite region, or as between two
  - timaeus says: that are heavy, as well as upper and lower, all the lines of
  - timaeus says: attraction will be found to become and remain relatively con-
  - timaeus says: trary and transverse and different in every possible way. But
  - timaeus says: with all of them this one principle is to be borne in mind, that
  - timaeus says: in every case it is the tendency towards the kindred element
  - timaeus says: that makes us call the falling body heavy, and the place to
  - timaeus says: which it falls, below ; while to the reverse relations we apply
  - timaeus says: the opposite names. So much then for the causes of these
  - timaeus says: conditions. Of the qualities of smooth and rough any one
  - timaeus says: could perceive the cause and explain it to another- the latter
  - timaeus says: is produced by a combination of hardness and irregularity, the
  - timaeus says: former by a combination of uniformity and density.

  - timaeus says: We have yet to consider the most important point
  - timaeus says: relating to the affections which concern the whole body in com-
  - timaeus says: mon ; that is, the cause of pleasure and pain accompanying
  - timaeus says: the sensations we have discussed - and also the affections which
  - timaeus says: produce sensation by means of the separate bodily organs and
  - timaeus says: which involve attendant pains and pleasures. This then is how
  - timaeus says: we must conceive the causes in the case of every affection,
  - timaeus says: sensible or insensible, recollecting how we defined above the
  - timaeus says: source of mobility and immobility - for this is the way we must
  - timaeus says: seek the explanation we hope to find. When that which is
  - timaeus says: naturally mobile is impressed by even a slight affection, it spreads
  - timaeus says: abroad the motion, the particles one upon another producing
  - timaeus says: the same effect, until coming to the sentient part it announces
  - timaeus says: the property of the agent - but a substance that is immobile
  - timaeus says: is too stable to spread the motion round about, and thus merely
  - timaeus says: receives the affection but does not stir any neighbouring part;
  - timaeus says: so that as the particles do not pass on one to another the
  - timaeus says: original impulse which affected them, they keep it untransmitted
  - timaeus says: to the entire creature and thus leave the recipient of the af-
  - timaeus says: fection without sensation. This takes place with our bones and
  - timaeus says: hair and all the parts we have which are formed mostly of
  - timaeus says: earth - while the former conditions apply in the highest degree
  - timaeus says: to sight and hearing, because they contain the greatest pro-
  - timaeus says: portion of fire and air. The nature of pleasure and pain must
  - timaeus says: be conceived thus - an affection contrary to nature, when it takes
  - timaeus says: place forcibly and suddenly within us, is painful ; a sudden
  - timaeus says: return to the natural state is pleasant; a gentle and gradual
  - timaeus says: process is imperceptible; and one of an opposite character is per-
  - timaeus says: ceptible. Now a process which takes place with perfect facility
  - timaeus says: is perceptible in a high degree, but is accompanied neither by
  - timaeus says: pleasure nor by pain. An example will be found in the affec-
  - timaeus says: tions of the visual current, which we said above was in the day-
  - timaeus says: time a material body cognate with ourselves. In this cutting and
  - timaeus says: burning and any other affection cause no, pain; nor does pleasure
  - timaeus says: ensue when it returns to its normal state - but its perceptions
  - timaeus says: are most vivid and accurate of whatsoever impresses it or what-
  - timaeus says: soever itself meets and touches. For its dilation and contraction
  - timaeus says: are entirely free from violence. On the other hand bodies
  - timaeus says: formed of larger particles, reluctantly yielding to the agent, and
  - timaeus says: spreading the motions through the whole frame, cause pleasure
  - timaeus says: and pain ; when they are disturbed giving pain, and pleasure
  - timaeus says: in being restored to their proper state. Those things which
  - timaeus says: suffer a gradual withdrawing and emptying, but have their
  - timaeus says: replenishment sudden and on a large scale, are insensible to
  - timaeus says: the emptying but sensible of the replenishment ; so that while
  - timaeus says: they cause no pain to the mortal part of the soul, they produce
  - timaeus says: very intense pleasure. This is to be observed in the case of
  - timaeus says: sweet smells. But when the parts are disturbed suddenly, but
  - timaeus says: gradually and laboriously restored to their- former condition,
  - timaeus says: they afford exactly the opposite result to the former - this may
  - timaeus says: be seen in the case of burns and cuts on the body.

  - timaeus says: Now the affections common to the body as a
  - timaeus says: whole and the names that have been given to the agents which
  - timaeus says: produce them have been well-nigh expounded - next we must
  - timaeus says: try to explain, if we can, what takes place in the separate parts
  - timaeus says: of us, both as to the affections of them and the causes on the
  - timaeus says: part of the agents. First then we must set forth to the best
  - timaeus says: of our p3wer all that we left unsaid concerning tastes, which
  - timaeus says: are affections peculiar to the tongue. It appears that these,
  - timaeus says: like most other things, are brought about by contraction and
  - timaeus says: dilation, besides which they have more to do than other sen-
  - timaeus says: sations with roughness and smoothness in the agents. For
  - timaeus says: whenever earthy particles enter in by the little veins which are
  - timaeus says: a kind of testing instruments of the tongue, stretched to the
  - timaeus says: heart, and strike upon the moist and soft parts of the flesh,
  - timaeus says: these particles as they are being dissolved contract and dry
  - timaeus says: the small veins ; and if they are very rough, they are termed
  - timaeus says: astringent; if less so 'harsh'. Such substances again as are
  - timaeus says: detergent and rinse the whole surface of the tongue, if they
  - timaeus says: do this to an excessive degree and encroach so as to dissolve
  - timaeus says: part of the structure of the flesh, as is the property of alka-
  - timaeus says: lies all such are termed 'bitter'- but those which fall short of
  - timaeus says: the alkaline quality and rinse the tongue only to a moderate
  - timaeus says: extent are saline without bitterness and seem to us agreeable
  - timaeus says: rather than the reverse. Those which share the warmth of
  - timaeus says: the mouth and are softened by it, being simultaneously in-
  - timaeus says: flamed and themselves in turn scorching that which heated
  - timaeus says: them, and which owing to their lightness fly upward to the
  - timaeus says: senses of the head, penetrating all that is in their path owing
  - timaeus says: to these properties all such substances are called ' pungent '.
  - timaeus says: But sometimes these same substances, having been already
  - timaeus says: refined by decomposition, enter into the narrow veins, being
  - timaeus says: duly proportioned to the earthy particles and the particles of
  - timaeus says: air which are there, so that they set them in motion and mingle
  - timaeus says: them together, and thereby cause them to jostle against one
  - timaeus says: another and taking up other positions to form new hollows
  - timaeus says: extended round the entering particles which hollows consist
  - timaeus says: of a film of moisture, sometimes earthy, sometimes pure, em-
  - timaeus says: bracing a volume of air ; and thus they form moist capsules con-
  - timaeus says: taining air - in some cases the films are of pure moisture and
  - timaeus says: transparent and are called bubbles ; in others they are of earthy
  - timaeus says: liquid which effervesces and rises all together, when the name
  - timaeus says: of seething and fermentation is given to it - and the cause
  - timaeus says: of all these conditions is termed ' acid '. The opposite affection
  - timaeus says: to all those which have been described is produced by an oppo-
  - timaeus says: site cause - when the structure of the entering particles amid
  - timaeus says: the moisture, having a natural affinity to the tongue's normal
  - timaeus says: condition, smooths it by mollifying the roughened parts, and
  - timaeus says: relaxes or contracts what is unnaturally contracted or expanded,
  - timaeus says: and settles everything as much as possible in its natural state.
  - timaeus says: Every such remedy of violent affections is to all of us pleasant
  - timaeus says: and agreeable, and has received the name of ' sweet '.

  - timaeus says: Enough of this subject. As regards the faculty
  - timaeus says: of the nostrils no classification can be made. For smells are
  - timaeus says: of a half-formed nature - and no class of figure has the adap-
  - timaeus says: tation requisite for producing any smell, but our veins in this
  - timaeus says: part are formed too narrow for earth and water, and too wide
  - timaeus says: for fire and air- for which cause no one ever perceived any
  - timaeus says: smell of these bodies ; but smells arise from substances which
  - timaeus says: are being either liquefied or decomposed or dissolved or evapo-
  - timaeus says: rated - for when water is changing into air and air into water,
  - timaeus says: odours arise in the intermediate condition ; and all odours are
  - timaeus says: vapour or mist, mist being the conversion of air into water, and
  - timaeus says: vapour the conversion of water into air ; whence all smells are
  - timaeus says: subtler than water and coarser than air. This is proved when
  - timaeus says: any obstacle is placed before the passages of respiration, and
  - timaeus says: then one forcibly inhales the air - for then no smell filters through
  - timaeus says: with it, but the air bereft of all scent alone follows the inhala-
  - timaeus says: tion. For this reason the complex varieties of odour are un-
  - timaeus says: named, and are ranked in classes neither numerous nor simple -
  - timaeus says: only two conspicuous kinds are in fact here distinguished, plea-
  - timaeus says: sant and unpleasant. The latter roughens and irritates all the
  - timaeus says: cavity of the body that is between the head and the navel ; the
  - timaeus says: former soothes this same region and restores it with contentment

  - timaeus says: A third organ of sensation in us which we have to examine
  - timaeus says: is that of hearing, and we must state the causes whence arise the
  - timaeus says: affections connected with it. Let us in general terms define
  - timaeus says: sound as a stroke transmitted through the ears by the air and
  - timaeus says: passed through the brain and the blood to the soul; while the
  - timaeus says: motion produced by it, beginning in the head and ending in the
  - timaeus says: region of the liver, is hearing. A rapid motion produces a shrill
  - timaeus says: sound, a slower one a deeper sound; regular vibration gives an
  - timaeus says: even and smooth sound, and the opposite a harsh one; if the
  - timaeus says: movement is large, the sound is loud; if otherwise, it is slight.

  - timaeus says: A fourth faculty of sense yet remains, the intricate
  - timaeus says: varieties of which it is our part to classify. To these we have
  - timaeus says: given the name of colours, which consist of a flame streaming off
  - timaeus says: from every object, having its particles so adjusted to those of
  - timaeus says: the visual current as to excite sensation. We have already set
  - timaeus says: forth the causes which gave origin to vision- thus therefore it
  - timaeus says: will be most natural and fitting for a rational theory to treat of
  - timaeus says: the question of colours. The particles which issue from outward
  - timaeus says: objects and meet the visual stream are some of them smaller,
  - timaeus says: some larger, and some equal in size to the particles of that
  - timaeus says: stream. Those of equal size cause no sensation, and these we
  - timaeus says: call transparent; but the larger and smaller, in the one case by
  - timaeus says: contracting, in the other by dilating it, produce effects akin to
  - timaeus says: the action of heat and cold on the flesh, and to the action on
  - timaeus says: the tongue of astringent tastes and the heating sensations which
  - timaeus says: we termed pungent. These are white and black, affections
  - timaeus says: identical with those just mentioned, but occurring in a different
  - timaeus says: class and seeming to be different for the causes aforesaid. We
  - timaeus says: must then classify them as follows. What dilates the visual
  - timaeus says: stream is white, and the opposite thereof is black. A swifter
  - timaeus says: motion belonging to a different kind of fire, which meets and
  - timaeus says: penetrates the visual stream quite up to the eyes, and forcibly
  - timaeus says: displaces and decomposes the pores of the eyes themselves,
  - timaeus says: draws from thence a combined body of fire and water, which
  - timaeus says: we call a tear- and whereas this agent is itself fire, meeting
  - timaeus says: the other from the opposite direction, and one fire leaps forth
  - timaeus says: as lightning from the eyes, while the other enters in and is
  - timaeus says: quenched in the moisture, all manner of colours arise in this
  - timaeus says: commixture; and to the sensation we give the name of dazzling,
  - timaeus says: and the agent which produces it we call bright and shining. A
  - timaeus says: kind of fire which is intermediate between the two former, when
  - timaeus says: it reaches the moisture of the eye and is mingled with it, but
  - timaeus says: does not flash, produces a blood-like colour by the mixture of
  - timaeus says: fire with the gleam of the moisture, and the name we give it
  - timaeus says: is red. Bright combined with red and white makes yellow. In
  - timaeus says: what proportion they are mingled, it were not reasonable to say,
  - timaeus says: even if we knew; for there is neither any inevitable law nor any
  - timaeus says: probable account thereof which we might properly declare. Red
  - timaeus says: mingled with black and white becomes purple, which turns to
  - timaeus says: dark violet when these ingredients are more burnt and a greater
  - timaeus says: quantity of black is added. Chestnut arises from the mixture
  - timaeus says: of yellow and grey, and grey from white and black - pale buff is
  - timaeus says: from white mixed with yellow. When bright meets white and
  - timaeus says: is steeped in intense black, a deep blue colour is the result; and
  - timaeus says: deep blue mingled with white produces pale blue; and chestnut
  - timaeus says: with black makes green. And for the remaining colours, it is
  - timaeus says: pretty clear from the foregoing to what combinations we ought
  - timaeus says: to assign them so as to preserve the probability of our account-
  - timaeus says: but if a man endeavour to make practical trial of these theories
  - timaeus says: he will prove himself ignorant of the difference between divine
  - timaeus says: and human intelligence - that God has sufficient understanding
  - timaeus says: and power to blend the many into one and again to resolve the
  - timaeus says: one into many; but no man is able to do either of these, now or

  - timaeus says: ture containing within itself all living creatures, mortal and
  - timaeus says: immortal, that exist. And of the divine he himself was the
  - timaeus says: creator; but the creation of mortals he delivered over to his own
  - timaeus says: children to work out. And they, in imitation of him, having
  - timaeus says: received from him the immortal principle of soul, fashioned
  - timaeus says: round about her a mortal body and gave her all the body to
  - timaeus says: ride in; and beside her they built in another kind of soul, even
  - timaeus says: that which is mortal, having within itself dread and inevitable
  - timaeus says: passions first pleasure, the strongest allurement of evil, next
  - timaeus says: pains, that scare good things away; confidence moreover and
  - timaeus says: fear, a yoke of thoughtless counsellors ; wrath hard to assuage
  - timaeus says: and hope that lightly leads astray; and having mingled all these
  - timaeus says: perforce with reasonless sensation and love that ventures all
  - timaeus says: things, so they fashioned the mortal soul. And for this cause,
  - timaeus says: in awe of defiling the divine, so far as was not altogether neces-
  - timaeus says: sary, they set the mortal kind to dwell apart from the other in
  - timaeus says: another chamber of the body, having built an isthmus and
  - timaeus says: boundary between the head and the breast, setting the neck
  - timaeus says: between them to keep them apart. So in the breast, or the
  - timaeus says: thorax as it is called, they confined the mortal kind of soul.
  - timaeus says: And whereas one part of -it was nobler, the other baser, they
  - timaeus says: built a party-wall across the hollow of the chest, as if they were
  - timaeus says: marking off an apartment for women and another for men, and
  - timaeus says: they put the midriff as a fence between them. That part of the
  - timaeus says: soul which shares courage and anger, seeing that it is warlike,
  - timaeus says: they planted nearer the head, between the midriff and the neck,
  - timaeus says: that it might be within hearing of the reason and might join it
  - timaeus says: in forcibly keeping down the tribe of lusts, when they would in
  - timaeus says: no wise consent to obey the order and word of command from
  - timaeus says: the citadel. And the heart, which is the knot of the veins and
  - timaeus says: the fount of the blood which rushes vehemently through all the
  - timaeus says: limbs, they made into the guardhouse, that whensoever the fury
  - timaeus says: of anger boiled up at the message from the reason, that some
  - timaeus says: unrighteous dealing is being wrought around them, either with-
  - timaeus says: out, or, it may be, by the lusts within, swiftly through all the
  - timaeus says: narrow channels all the sensitive power in the body might be
  - timaeus says: aware of the admonitions and threats and be obedient to them
  - timaeus says: and follow them altogether, and so permit the noblest part to be

  - timaeus says: devised a plan of relief, and framed within us the structure of
  - timaeus says: the lungs, which in the first place is soft and void of blood, and
  - timaeus says: next is perforated within with cavities like those of a sponge, in
  - timaeus says: order that receiving the breath and the drink it might cause

  - timaeus says: and drink and all things whereof it has need owing to the

  - timaeus says: as its boundary, constructing in all this region as it were a
  - timaeus says: manger for the sustenance of the body - and here they chained
  - timaeus says: it like a wild beast, which must yet be reared in conjunction
  - timaeus says: with the rest, if a mortal race were to be at all. To the end
  - timaeus says: then that always feeding at its stall and dwelling as far as
  - timaeus says: possible from the seat of counsel, it might produce the least
  - timaeus says: possible tumult and uproar and allow the noblest part to con-
  - timaeus says: sult in peace for the common weal, here they assigned it its
  - timaeus says: place. And knowing that it would have no comprehension of
  - timaeus says: reason, and that even if it did in some way gain any perception
  - timaeus says: of rational thoughts, it was not in its nature to take heed to
  - timaeus says: any such things, but that it would be entirely led away by
  - timaeus says: images and shadows both by night and by day, God devised as
  - timaeus says: a remedy for this the nature of the liver, which he constructed
  - timaeus says: and set in its dwelling place - and he made it a body dense and
  - timaeus says: smooth and bright and sweet with a share of bitterness. This
  - timaeus says: he did to the end that the influence of thoughts proceeding
  - timaeus says: from the brain, when the liver received outlines of them, as if in
  - timaeus says: a mirror, and exhibited reflections to view, might strike terror
  - timaeus says: into the appetitive part, whenever making use of the bitter
  - timaeus says: element akin to its own dark nature and threatening with stern
  - timaeus says: approach, diffusing the bitterness swiftly throughout the whole
  - timaeus says: liver it displayed a bilious colour, and contracting it made it
  - timaeus says: all rough and wrinkled, and reaching the lobe and the vessels
  - timaeus says: and the inlet, twisted the first from its right position and con-
  - timaeus says: torted it, while at the same time it obstructed and closed up the
  - timaeus says: two latter, thereby producing pain and nausea - and on the
  - timaeus says: other hand in order that, whenever a breath of mildness from
  - timaeus says: the reason copied off on the liver visions of an opposite kind,
  - timaeus says: giving relief from the bitterness, because it will not excite a
  - timaeus says: nature opposite to its own nor have dealing with it, but using
  - timaeus says: upon the liver the sweetness that exists therein and soothing
  - timaeus says: everything till all is straight and smooth and free, it might
  - timaeus says: render gentle and calm that part of the soul which is settled
  - timaeus says: about the liver, and might enable it to secure a sober amuse-
  - timaeus says: ment at night, enjoying divination during sleep, in recompense
  - timaeus says: for its deprivation of intelligence and wisdom. For our creators,
  - timaeus says: because they remembered the behest of their father, when he
  - timaeus says: commanded them to make the mortal race as perfect as they
  - timaeus says: were able, in this wise redeeming even the baser part of us,

  - timaeus says: Now that divination is the gift of God to human folly, this is
  - timaeus says: a sufficient proof. No man in his sound senses deals in true
  - timaeus says: and inspired divination, but when the power of his under-
  - timaeus says: standing is fettered in sleep or by sickness, or if he has become
  - timaeus says: distraught by some divine possession. The part of the sane
  - timaeus says: man is to remember and interpret all things that are declared,

  - timaeus says: whatsoever visions are beheld by the seer, to determine by
  - timaeus says: reason in what way and to whom they betoken good or ill in
  - timaeus says: the future or the present or the past - but it is not for him who
  - timaeus says: has become mad and still is in that state to judge his own
  - timaeus says: visions and utterances ; the old saying remains true, that only
  - timaeus says: for the sane man is it meet to act and to be the judge of his
  - timaeus says: own actions and of himself. Whence has arisen the custom .of
  - timaeus says: setting up interpreters as judges of inspired prophecy - these are
  - timaeus says: themselves called prophets by some who are altogether un-
  - timaeus says: aware that they are but the expounders of mystic speech and
  - timaeus says: visions, and ought not in strict accuracy to be called prophets,
  - timaeus says: but interpreters of the prophecies.
  - timaeus says: Such is the nature of the liver and its situation that we
  - timaeus says: have described, for the purpose of prophecy as aforesaid. And
  - timaeus says: while each body has life, this organ displays the signs clearly
  - timaeus says: enough ; but when deprived of life, it is become blind and gives
  - timaeus says: the token too dimly to afford any plain meaning. And the
  - timaeus says: structure of the neighbouring organ and its position on the left
  - timaeus says: has been planned for the sake of the liver, in order to keep it
  - timaeus says: always bright and clean, as a napkin is prepared and laid ready
  - timaeus says: for the cleansing of a mirror. Wherefore whenever any im-
  - timaeus says: purities arise in the region of the liver owing to sickness of the
  - timaeus says: body, all is received and purified by the fine substance of the
  - timaeus says: spleen, which is woven hollow and void of blood. This, when it
  - timaeus says: is filled with the impurities from the liver, waxes swollen and
  - timaeus says: festered ; and again, when the body is purged, it is reduced and

  - timaeus says: to conceive that it is constructed. They who framed our race

  - timaeus says: and coiled the bowels round about therein, lest the food passing

  - timaeus says: Concerning the bones and flesh and all such substances the
  - timaeus says: case stands thus. The foundation of all these is the marrow -
  - timaeus says: for the bonds of life whereby the soul is bound to the body
  - timaeus says: were fastened in it throughout and planted therein the roots
  - timaeus says: of human nature. But the marrow itself comes from other
  - timaeus says: sources. Such of the primal triangles as were unwarped and
  - timaeus says: smooth and thus able to produce fire and water and air and
  - timaeus says: earth of the purest quality, these God selected and set apart,
  - timaeus says: each from its own class, and mingling them in proportion one
  - timaeus says: with another, to make a common seed for all the race of mortals,
  - timaeus says: he formed of them the marrow ; and thereafter he implanted
  - timaeus says: and fastened in it the several kinds of soul ; and according to
  - timaeus says: the number and fashion of the shapes that the soul should have
  - timaeus says: corresponding to her kinds, into so many similar forms did he
  - timaeus says: divide the marrow at the very outset of his distribution. And
  - timaeus says: that which should be as it were a field to contain in it the divine
  - timaeus says: seed he moulded in a spherical form all round ; and this part of
  - timaeus says: the marrow he called the brain, with the view that, when each
  - timaeus says: animal was completed, the vessel containing it should be the
  - timaeus says: head. But that which was to have the mortal part of soul
  - timaeus says: which remained he distributed into moulds that were at once
  - timaeus says: round and elongated - but he called all these forms marrow ;
  - timaeus says: and from these, as though from anchors, he put forth bonds to
  - timaeus says: fasten all the soul, and then he wrought the entire body round
  - timaeus says: about it, first building to fence it a covering of bone. And
  - timaeus says: bone he formed in this way - having sifted out earth that was
  - timaeus says: pure and smooth he kneaded and soaked it with marrow, and
  - timaeus says: after that he placed it in fire ; and next he set it in water, and
  - timaeus says: again in fire, and once more in water - and thus having shifted
  - timaeus says: it many times from one to another he made it indissoluble by
  - timaeus says: either. Making use of this, he carved a bony sphere thereof to
  - timaeus says: surround the brain, but on one side he left a narrow outlet ; and
  - timaeus says: around the marrow of the neck and back he made vertebrae of
  - timaeus says: bone and set them to serve as pivots, beginning at the head and
  - timaeus says: carrying them through the whole length of the body. Thus to
  - timaeus says: preserve all the seed he enclosed it in a strong envelope, and he
  - timaeus says: made joints in it, using the power of the Other as an inter-
  - timaeus says: mediary between the parts, for the sake of moving and bending
  - timaeus says: them. But deeming that the structure of bone was too rigid
  - timaeus says: and inflexible, and that should it be inflamed and cooled again,
  - timaeus says: it would rot away and quickly destroy the seed within it, for this
  - timaeus says: cause God devised the sinews and the flesh, that binding all the
  - timaeus says: limbs together with the former he might by their tension and
  - timaeus says: relaxation round their pivots enable the body to bend and ex-
  - timaeus says: tend itself; while the flesh he designed as a defence against
  - timaeus says: heat and a shelter from cold ; and moreover that it might be,
  - timaeus says: like coverings of felt, a protection against falls, gently and easily
  - timaeus says: yielding to external bodies; and containing a warm moisture
  - timaeus says: within itself, in summer it might exude this, and spreading
  - timaeus says: dampness on the surface might diffuse a natural coolness over
  - timaeus says: all the body; but in winter on the other hand it might by its
  - timaeus says: own fire afford a fair protection against the frost that assailed
  - timaeus says: and surrounded it from without Considering this, he that
  - timaeus says: moulded us like wax made a mixture and blending of water
  - timaeus says: and fire and earth ; and compounding a ferment of acid and salt
  - timaeus says: he mingled it with them and produced soft flesh full of sap - the
  - timaeus says: sinews he composed of bone and unfermented flesh, a separate
  - timaeus says: substance having an intermediate function; and to this he added
  - timaeus says: a yellow colour. Accordingly the sinews received a power more
  - timaeus says: firm and tenacious than the flesh, but more soft and flexible
  - timaeus says: than the bones.

  - show timaeus: talk AT CENTER
  - timaeus says: With these God covered the bones and marrow; and after he
  - timaeus says: had bound one part to another with sinews, he enveloped them
  - timaeus says: over all with flesh. Those bones which were chiefly inhabited
  - timaeus says: by soul, he enclosed with the smallest amount of flesh ; but
  - timaeus says: those wherein was least soul he covered most abundantly and
  - timaeus says: densely with it - moreover at the joints of the bones, save where
  - timaeus says: reason showed that it ought to be there, he put but little flesh,
  - timaeus says: that neither it might render the body unwieldy by hindering its
  - timaeus says: flexions and impeding its .motions, nor again that a dense mass
  - timaeus says: of flesh piled together, producing by its hardness a dulness of
  - timaeus says: sensation, might render the faculties of the mind too slow of
  - timaeus says: memory and hard of apprehension. Wherefore the thighs and
  - timaeus says: the shins and the parts about the hips and the bones in the
  - timaeus says: upper arms and the fore-arms and all parts of our limbs which
  - timaeus says: are without joints, and all bones which are devoid of intelligence
  - timaeus says: owing to the small amount of soul inhering in marrow within
  - timaeus says: them, all these are abundantly furnished with flesh; but those
  - timaeus says: which are the seat of intelligence have less- except in cases
  - timaeus says: where God has formed the flesh to be in itself an organ of
  - timaeus says: sensation, as for instance the tongue- in most however it is as
  - timaeus says: aforesaid; for this material nature which comes into being by
  - timaeus says: the law of necessity and is reared with us does not allow dense
  - timaeus says: bone and much flesh to be accompanied by ready and keen per-
  - timaeus says: ception. For had these two conditions consented to combine,
  - timaeus says: the structure of the head would have displayed them in the
  - timaeus says: highest degree ; and the human being, bearing upon it a fleshy
  - timaeus says: head, sinewy and strong, would have enjoyed a life twice, nay
  - timaeus says: many times as long as now, besides being much more healthy
  - timaeus says: and free from pain. But as it is, the creators who brought us to
  - timaeus says: being considered whether they should make a long-lived race
  - timaeus says: that was inferior, or one more short-lived which was nobler, and
  - timaeus says: they agreed that every one must by all means choose a shorter
  - timaeus says: and nobler life in preference to a longer but baser. Therefore
  - timaeus says: they covered the head with thin bone, but not with flesh
  - timaeus says: nor sinews, since it has no flexions. On all these grounds the
  - timaeus says: head that is set upon the body of every man is much quicker of
  - timaeus says: apprehension and understanding, but much weaker. For these
  - timaeus says: reasons and in this manner God placed the sinews all round the
  - timaeus says: base of the head about the neck and cemented them with
  - timaeus says: uniformity; and he fastened the extremities of the jaw - bones to
  - timaeus says: them just under the face; and the rest he distributed over all
  - timaeus says: the limbs, uniting joint to joint. And our framers ordained the
  - timaeus says: functions of the mouth, furnishing it with teeth and tongue and
  - timaeus says: lips, in the way it is now arranged, combining in their purpose
  - timaeus says: the necessary and the best; for they devised the incoming with
  - timaeus says: the necessary in view, but the outgoing with the most excellent.
  - timaeus says: For all that enters in to give sustenance to the body is of neces-
  - timaeus says: sity; but the stream of speech which flows out and ministers to
  - timaeus says: understanding is of all streams the most noble and excellent.
  - timaeus says: But as to the head, it was neither possible to leave it of bare
  - timaeus says: bone, owing to the extremes of heat and cold in the seasons;
  - timaeus says: nor yet by covering it over to allow it to become dull and sense-
  - timaeus says: less through the burden of flesh. Of the fleshy material as it was
  - timaeus says: drying a larger film formed on the surface and separated itself;
  - timaeus says: this is what is now called skin. This by the influence of the
  - timaeus says: moisture of the brain combined and grew up and clothed the
  - timaeus says: head all round- and the moisture rising up under the sutures
  - timaeus says: saturated and closed it in on the crown, fastening it together
  - timaeus says: like a knot. Now the form of the sutures is manifold, owing to
  - timaeus says: the power of the soul's revolutions and of the aliment; if these
  - timaeus says: contend more vehemently one with another, the sutures are more
  - timaeus says: in number; but if less so, they are fewer. Now the whole of
  - timaeus says: this skin was pricked all about with fire by the divine part- and
  - timaeus says: when it v/as pierced and the moisture issued forth through it, all
  - timaeus says: the moisture and heat which was pure vanished away; but that
  - timaeus says: which was mingled with the substances whereof the skin was
  - timaeus says: formed, being lifted up by the impulse, stretched far outwards,
  - timaeus says: in fineness equalling the size of the puncture; but owing to the
  - timaeus says: slowness of its motion it was thrust back by the surrounding air,
  - timaeus says: and being forced in and rolled up under the skin it took root
  - timaeus says: there. Under these conditions hair grows up in the skin, being
  - timaeus says: of similar nature but of threadlike appearance, and made harder
  - timaeus says: and denser by the contraction of cooling- for every hair in being
  - timaeus says: separated from the skin was cooled and contracted. Hereby
  - timaeus says: has our creator made our.head hairy, using the means aforesaid,
  - timaeus says: and conceiving that this instead of flesh should be a covering for
  - timaeus says: the protection of the brain, being light and capable of affording
  - timaeus says: shade from heat and shelter from cold, while it would be no
  - timaeus says: hindrance in the way of ready apprehension. The threefold
  - timaeus says: combination of sinew skin and bone in the fabric of the fingers,
  - timaeus says: when dried, forms out of all a single hard skin, for the construc-
  - timaeus says: tion of which these substances served as means, but the true
  - timaeus says: cause and purpose of its formation was the welfare of races not
  - timaeus says: yet existing. For our creators were aware that men should pass
  - timaeus says: into women, and afterwards into beasts; and they knew that
  - timaeus says: many creatures would need the aid of nails for many purposes -
  - timaeus says: wherefore at the very birth of the human race they fashioned
  - timaeus says: the rudiments of nails. On such reasoning and with such
  - timaeus says: purposes did they form skin and hair, and on the extremities of
  - timaeus says: the limbs nails.

  - timaeus says: about its own centre, it rejects all motion from without and uses
  - timaeus says: only its own ; but its nature has not bestowed upon it any power
  - timaeus says: of observing its own being and reflecting thereon. Wherefore
  - timaeus says: it is indeed alive and in no wise differs from an animal, but it is

  - timaeus says: as sustenance for us who were feebler; and next they made
  - timaeus says: canals in the substance of our body, as though they were
  - timaeus says: cutting runnels in a garden, that it might be irrigated as by an
  - timaeus says: inflowing stream. And first they carried like hidden rills, under
  - timaeus says: the place where the skin and the flesh are joined, two veins
  - timaeus says: down the back, following the twofold division of the body into
  - timaeus says: right and left. These they brought down on either side of the
  - timaeus says: spine and the seminal marrow, first in order that this might be
  - timaeus says: most vigorous, next that the current might have an easy flow
  - timaeus says: downwards and render the irrigation regular. After that, they
  - timaeus says: cleft the veins around the head, and interweaving them crossed
  - timaeus says: them in opposite directions, carrying these from the right side of
  - timaeus says: the body to the left and those from the left to the right. This
  - timaeus says: they did, partly in order that together with the skin they might
  - timaeus says: form a bond to fasten the head to the body, seeing that it was
  - timaeus says: not set round with sinews on the crown ; and also that this
  - timaeus says: might be a means of distributing from each side throughout
  - timaeus says: the whole body the sensation due to the perceptions. And
  - timaeus says: next to this they designed the irrigation on a kind of plan
  - timaeus says: which we shall better discern by assuming the following premises.
  - timaeus says: All bodies which are composed of smaller particles exclude the
  - timaeus says: larger, but the larger cannot exclude the smaller. Fire is com-
  - timaeus says: posed of finer particles than any other element, whence it
  - timaeus says: penetrates through water and earth and air and whatever is
  - timaeus says: composed of them, and nothing can keep it out. This rule
  - timaeus says: must also be applied to the human belly ; when food and
  - timaeus says: drink enter into it, it keeps them in ; but air and fire, being
  - timaeus says: finer than its own structure, it cannot keep in. Accordingly
  - timaeus says: God used these two elements for the conveyance of liquid
  - timaeus says: from the belly to the veins, weaving of air and fire a network
  - timaeus says: like a fish-trap or'weel, having two lesser weels within with a
  - timaeus says: double inlet ; one of which inlets he again wove with two pas-
  - timaeus says: sages ; and from the lesser weels he stretched as it were cords
  - timaeus says: on all sides to the extremities of the network. All the inner
  - timaeus says: part of the net he constructed of fire, but the lesser weels and
  - timaeus says: the envelope he made of airy substance ; and he took the net
  - timaeus says: and wrapped it in manner following about the animal he had
  - timaeus says: moulded. The structure of the lesser weels he carried into the
  - timaeus says: mouth - and, these being twofold, he let down one of them by
  - timaeus says: the windpipe into the lungs, the other past the windpipe into
  - timaeus says: the belly. The one weel he split in two, and let both inlets
  - timaeus says: meet by the passages of the nostrils, so that when the first
  - timaeus says: inlet was not in action by way of the mouth, all its currents also
  - timaeus says: might be replenished from the second. But with the general
  - timaeus says: surface of the network he enveloped all the hollow part of our
  - timaeus says: body; and all this, seeing it was air, he now caused to flow
  - timaeus says: gently into the lesser weels, now made them flow back upon it
  - timaeus says: and since the body is of porous texture, the network passes
  - timaeus says: through it inward and again outward, and the beams of fire
  - timaeus says: which are confined within follow the air as it moves in either
  - timaeus says: direction - and this never ceases to go on so long as the mortal
  - timaeus says: creature holds together. To this process he who appointed
  - timaeus says: names gave, we say, the titles of inspiration and expiration -
  - timaeus says: and from this condition, both active and passive, it has come
  - timaeus says: about that our body, deriving moisture and coolness, has its
  - timaeus says: sustenance and life. For when, as the respiration passes in and
  - timaeus says: out, the interwoven fire within follows it and entering the belly
  - timaeus says: swings up and down and meets the food and drink, it dis-
  - timaeus says: solves them, and reducing them to small particles, drives them
  - timaeus says: along the channels through which it flows, pumping them into
  - timaeus says: the veins like spring-water into conduits, and so it makes the
  - timaeus says: current of the veins flow through the body as through an
  - timaeus says: aqueduct.

  - timaeus says: Let us once more examine the process of respira-
  - timaeus says: tion and the causes which have led to its present conditions.
  - timaeus says: These are as follows. Since there is no void into which any
  - timaeus says: moving body could enter, and since the breath issues forth
  - timaeus says: from us, the consequence is clear to every one - instead of
  - timaeus says: entering into a void space it thrusts the neighbouring matter out
  - timaeus says: of its place. And this, yielding to the thrust, drives before it
  - timaeus says: that which is immediately nearest ; and all being driven round
  - timaeus says: by this compulsion enters into the place whence the breath
  - timaeus says: came forth, and replenishing the same follows after the breath
  - timaeus says: and this whole process goes on like the rotation of a wheel,
  - timaeus says: because there is no void. Therefore when the cavity of the
  - timaeus says: chest and the lungs send forth the breath, they are again re-
  - timaeus says: plenished by the air surrounding the body, which penetrates
  - timaeus says: inwards through the flesh, seeing it is porous, and is forced
  - timaeus says: round in a circuit. And again when the air returns and passes
  - timaeus says: forth through the body, it thrusts the breath back again in-
  - timaeus says: wards through the passages of the mouth and nostrils. The
  - timaeus says: cause which sets this principle in action we may describe thus.
  - timaeus says: In every animal the inner parts about the blood and veins are
  - timaeus says: the hottest, as if there were a fount of fire contained in it. This
  - timaeus says: is what we compare to the network of the weel, supposing
  - timaeus says: that all the part extending from the middle to the sides
  - timaeus says: is woven of fire, but the outer part of air. Now we must
  - timaeus says: admit that the heat naturally tends outwards to its own region
  - timaeus says: and its own kin. And whereas there are two means of egress,
  - timaeus says: one out through the body, the other by way of the mouth and
  - timaeus says: nostrils, when it makes for one exit, it impels the air round
  - timaeus says: towards the other. And the air so impelled falling into the fire
  - timaeus says: is heated, but that which passes out is cooled. So the heat
  - timaeus says: changes its position and the parts about the other outlet be-
  - timaeus says: come warmer ; therefore the heat now has a stronger tendency in
  - timaeus says: the new direction, seeking its own affinity, and impels the air by
  - timaeus says: the other passage - and this, undergoing the same change and
  - timaeus says: reproducing the same process, is thus by these two impulses
  - timaeus says: converted into a wheel swaying backwards and forwards, and so
  - timaeus says: it gives rise to respiration.

  - timaeus says: explanation of the phenomena of medical cupping-glasses and
  - timaeus says: of swallowing and of projected bodies, whether cast through the
  - timaeus says: air or moving along the ground ; and of sounds too, which
  - timaeus says: from their swiftness and slowness seem to us shrill or deep,
  - timaeus says: sometimes having no harmony in their movements owing to the
  - timaeus says: irregularity of the vibrations they produce in us, sometimes
  - timaeus says: being harmonious through regularity. For the slower sounds
  - timaeus says: overtake the motions of the first and swifter sounds, when
  - timaeus says: these are already beginning to die away and have become
  - timaeus says: assimilated to the motions which the slower on their arrival
  - timaeus says: impart to them - and on overtaking them they do not produce
  - timaeus says: discord by the intrusion of an alien movement, but adding the
  - timaeus says: commencement of a slower motion, which corresponds to that
  - timaeus says: of the swifter now that the latter is beginning to cease, they
  - timaeus says: form one harmonious sensation by the blending of shrill and
  - timaeus says: deep. Thereby they afford pleasure to the foolish, but to the
  - timaeus says: wise joy, through the imitation of the divine harmony which is

  - timaeus says: fall of thunderbolts, and the wonderful attracting power of
  - timaeus says: amber and of the loadstone all these are due to no drawing
  - timaeus says: power, but to two causes- first there is no void, and the
  - timaeus says: atoms jostle one upon another ; secondly when they are divided
  - timaeus says: or contracted they change places and move severally towards
  - timaeus says: their own region ; and by the complication of such conditions
  - timaeus says: all these wonders arise, as will be plain to him who examines
  - timaeus says: them by the proper method.

  - timaeus says: The process of respiration then, whence this
  - timaeus says: discussion arose, rests on the principles and causes which have
  - timaeus says: been set forth - fire divides the food, following the air as it
  - timaeus says: sways up and down within ; and through this oscillation it re-
  - timaeus says: plenishes the veins from the belly by pumping into them from
  - timaeus says: thence the comminuted food. In this way throughout the whole
  - timaeus says: body of all animals the streams of nourishment are kept con-
  - timaeus says: stantly supplied. And the particles of food, being freshly severed
  - timaeus says: and from kindred substances some from fruits and some from
  - timaeus says: herbs, which God planted just to be our sustenance, have all
  - timaeus says: manner of colours owing to their intermixture; but a red hue per-
  - timaeus says: vades them most of all, through the natural contrivance whereby
  - timaeus says: the fire divides the food and imprints its own hue upon it -
  - timaeus says: whence the colour of the fluid that circulates through the body
  - timaeus says: has the appearance we have described. This we call blood,
  - timaeus says: which is the sustenance of the flesh and of all the body, and
  - timaeus says: from which all parts draw moisture to fill up the places that are
  - timaeus says: left void. And the mode of replenishment and evacuation is
  - timaeus says: like the motion of all things in the universe, whereby all kindred
  - timaeus says: substances seek each other. The elements that surround us
  - timaeus says: without are constantly dissolving our substance and distributing
  - timaeus says: it to its several kinds, returning each to its own kindred - and
  - timaeus says: again the particles of blood, being minutely divided within us
  - timaeus says: and enveloped in every creature by the body, as though by a
  - timaeus says: heaven surrounding them, are forced to copy the universal
  - timaeus says: motion. Therefore each of the divided particles within us is
  - timaeus says: carried to its own kind and thus replenishes again what was left
  - timaeus says: void. Now when the loss is greater than the replenishment,
  - timaeus says: everything diminishes, but when less, it increases. The young
  - timaeus says: frame then of the entire creature, having the triangles of its ele-
  - timaeus says: ments still as if fresh from the workshop, has them firmly linked
  - timaeus says: one to another ; but the whole mass is soft in substance, seeing
  - timaeus says: that it has been newly formed out of marrow and nurtured upon
  - timaeus says: milk. Now forasmuch as the triangles of the substances com-
  - timaeus says: posing the food and drink, which enter from without and are
  - timaeus says: received within the young creature, are older and feebler than
  - timaeus says: those of the latter, it divides and subdues them with its new
  - timaeus says: triangles, and by the assimilation of a large number nourishes
  - timaeus says: and increases the animal - but when the exact outline of the
  - timaeus says: triangles is blunted, because they have been for a long time
  - timaeus says: struggling with many others, they are not able as of old to
  - timaeus says: comminute and assimilate the entering aliment, but are them-
  - timaeus says: selves easily divided by the incoming particles. At such a time
  - timaeus says: every living thing is enfeebled and wastes away; and this con-
  - timaeus says: dition is termed old age. Finally when the bonds of the tri-
  - timaeus says: angles belonging to the ma/row no longer hold to their fasten-
  - timaeus says: ings but snap asunder with the stress, they loose in their turn
  - timaeus says: the bonds of the soul ; and she, being in the course of nature
  - timaeus says: released, flies away with gladness. For all that is contrary to
  - timaeus says: nature is painful ; but whatsoever takes place in the natural way
  - timaeus says: is pleasant. On the same principle death which ensues upon
  - timaeus says: sickness or wounds is painful and violent ; but that which draws
  - timaeus says: to the natural end in the course of old age is of all deaths the
  - timaeus says: least distressing and is accompanied rather by pleasure than by
  - timaeus says: pain.

  - timaeus says: Now the cause whence sicknesses arise is doubt-
  - timaeus says: less evident to all. For seeing there are four elements of which
  - timaeus says: the body is composed, earth fire water and air, any unnatural
  - timaeus says: excess or defect of these or change of position from their own
  - timaeus says: to an alien region, and also since there are more than one
  - timaeus says: kind of fire and the other elements the reception by each of
  - timaeus says: an unfitting kind, and other such causes, all combine to pro-
  - timaeus says: duce discord and disease. For when any of them changes
  - timaeus says: its nature and position, the parts that formerly were cool are
  - timaeus says: heated, and those that were dry become afterwards moist, and
  - timaeus says: the light become heavy, and all undergo every kind of change.
  - timaeus says: The only way we allow in which one and the same substance
  - timaeus says: can remain whole and unchanged and sound is that the same
  - timaeus says: element should be added to it or taken away from it on the
  - timaeus says: same principle and in the same manner and proportion; and
  - timaeus says: whatsoever errs in any of these points in its outgoings or in-
  - timaeus says: comings causes a vast diversity of vicissitudes and diseases and
  - timaeus says: destructions. Next in the secondary structures which are in a
  - timaeus says: natural state of union a second class of diseases may be dis-
  - timaeus says: cerned by one who would scrutinise them. For whereas marrow
  - timaeus says: and bone and flesh and sinew are composed of the four elements,
  - timaeus says: and blood is formed of the same though in a different way, most
  - timaeus says: of the diseases arise in the manner before explained, but the
  - timaeus says: gravest afflict them with especial severity in the following way -
  - timaeus says: that is to say, when the order of their generation is reversed,
  - timaeus says: these structures are then destroyed. For in the course of nature
  - timaeus says: flesh and sinews arise from blood, the sinews from the fibrine,
  - timaeus says: owing to their affinity; the flesh from the clots which are formed
  - timaeus says: when the fibrine is separated. From the sinews and flesh again
  - timaeus says: proceeds a glutinous and oily fluid, which not only cements the
  - timaeus says: flesh to the structure of the bones and itself gives nourishment
  - timaeus says: and growth to the bone which encloses the marrow, but also so
  - timaeus says: much of it as filters through the dense substance of the bones,
  - timaeus says: being formed of the purest and smoothest and most slippery
  - timaeus says: kind of the triangles, as it distils and oozes from the bones,
  - timaeus says: irrigates the marrow. When these structures are produced in
  - timaeus says: this order, health is the result as a rule ; but when this is re-
  - timaeus says: versed, sickness ensues. For when the flesh decomposes and
  - timaeus says: returns the deliquescent matter to the veins, then is mingled
  - timaeus says: with air in the veins much blood of manifold kinds, with
  - timaeus says: diverse hues and bitter qualities, as well as acid and saline
  - timaeus says: properties ; and this contains all kinds of bile and serum and
  - timaeus says: phlegm. For as all these are going the wrong way and have
  - timaeus says: become corrupt, first they ruin the blood itself, and furnishing
  - timaeus says: no nutriment to the body rush in all directions through the
  - timaeus says: veins, paying no heed to the periods appointed by nature, but
  - timaeus says: at war one with another, because they have no gcod of each
  - timaeus says: other ; at war also with all that is established and fixed in the
  - timaeus says: body, which they corrupt and dissolve. Now when the oldest
  - timaeus says: part of the flesh is decomposed, being hard to soften, it turns
  - timaeus says: black through long-continued burning, and through being every-
  - timaeus says: where corroded it is bitter and dangerous to whatever part of
  - timaeus says: the body it attacks which is not yet corrupted. Sometimes this
  - timaeus says: black sort is acid instead of bitter, when the bitterness is more
  - timaeus says: refined away ; and again the bitter sort being steeped in blood
  - timaeus says: gains a redder hue; and when black is mingled with this, it is
  - timaeus says: greenish - sometimes too a yellow colour is added to the bitter-
  - timaeus says: ness, when new flesh is decomposed by the fire of the inflam-
  - timaeus says: mation. To all these symptoms the general name of bile has
  - timaeus says: been given, either by physicians, or by some one who in looking
  - timaeus says: at many dissimilar appearances was able to see one universal
  - timaeus says: quality pervading them all which deserved a name. All other
  - timaeus says: kinds of bile which are reckoned have their several descriptions
  - timaeus says: according to their colour. Of lymph, one kind is the mild
  - timaeus says: serum of blood, the other is an acrid secretion of black and
  - timaeus says: acid bile, when that is blended through inflammation with a
  - timaeus says: saline property - this kind is called acid phlegm. But that
  - timaeus says: which is formed in conjunction with air by the liquefaction
  - timaeus says: of new and tender flesh, when it is inflated with air en-
  - timaeus says: veloped by moisture, and through this condition bubbles are
  - timaeus says: formed, invisible separately because of their smallness, but all
  - timaeus says: together becoming visible in the mass and presenting a white
  - timaeus says: colour to view by the formation of froth this liquefaction of
  - timaeus says: tender flesh in combination with air we term white phlegm.
  - timaeus says: And the serum of freshly formed phlegm is sweat and tears,
  - timaeus says: and whatever other secretions purify the body from day to day.
  - timaeus says: All these become a means of disease, when the blood is not
  - timaeus says: replenished from the food and drink in the natural way, but
  - timaeus says: receives its volume in the contrary manner in despite of natures
  - timaeus says: laws. Now when the flesh is anywhere pierced by disease, but
  - timaeus says: the foundations of it remain intact, the malady has only half its
  - timaeus says: power; for there is still the prospect of ready recovery. But
  - timaeus says: when that which unites the flesh to the bones is diseased, and
  - timaeus says: in turn no longer by distilling both from the fibres and sinews
  - timaeus says: nourishes the bones and cements the flesh to them, but
  - timaeus says: instead of being oily and smooth and glutinous becomes harsh
  - timaeus says: and saline and shrivelled through an unhealthy habit of life,
  - timaeus says: under these conditions all that substance crumbles away under
  - timaeus says: the flesh and the sinews and separates from the bones; while
  - timaeus says: the flesh, falling away from its foundations, leaves the sinews
  - timaeus says: bare and full of brine, and itself falling back into the current of
  - timaeus says: the blood aggravates the diseases that have been described.
  - timaeus says: But distressing as are these symptoms which affect the body,
  - timaeus says: yet more serious are those which are prior in order ; when the
  - timaeus says: bones, owing to denseness of the flesh, cannot get sufficient air
  - timaeus says: and becoming mouldy and heated decay away, and while they
  - timaeus says: will not receive their nourishment, crumble down and return by
  - timaeus says: a reversed process into their nourishing fluid, and that in its turn
  - timaeus says: passing into flesh, and the flesh into blood, they render all the
  - timaeus says: diseases more virulent than those already mentioned. The most
  - timaeus says: desperate case of all is when the substance of the marrow be-
  - timaeus says: comes diseased by any defect or excess - this produces the most
  - timaeus says: serious and fatal disorders, seeing that the whole nature of the
  - timaeus says: body is forced to proceed in a backward course.

  - timaeus says: A third class of diseases we must conceive as occurring
  - timaeus says: in three ways - one by the agency of air, the second of phlegm,
  - timaeus says: the third of bile. For when the lungs, which are the dispensers
  - timaeus says: of air to the body, do not keep their passages clear, because
  - timaeus says: they are impeded by catarrhs, the air, failing to pass through
  - timaeus says: some, and in others entering with a volume unduly great, causes
  - timaeus says: the decomposition of the parts which lack their supply of air,
  - timaeus says: and forces its way through the channels of the veins and dis-
  - timaeus says: locates them, and dissolving the body it is confined amid its
  - timaeus says: substance, occupying the midriff; and so countless painful
  - timaeus says: diseases are produced from these causes, accompanied by
  - timaeus says: excessive sweat. Often too when the flesh is broken up, air
  - timaeus says: is formed in the body, and being unable to find an exit it pro-
  - timaeus says: duces the same torments as are caused by the air which enters
  - timaeus says: in ; the most severe of all, when gathering and swelling up
  - timaeus says: around the sinews and the blood-vessels in these parts it strains
  - timaeus says: the tendons of the shoulders and the muscles attached to them
  - timaeus says: in a backward direction - and owing to the intense strain pro-
  - timaeus says: duced in this condition these affections are called tetanus and
  - timaeus says: opisthotonus. For these the remedy is severe - for in fact fevers
  - timaeus says: supervening chiefly give relief in such cases. The white phlegm
  - timaeus says: when intercepted is dangerous owing to the air in the bubbles -
  - timaeus says: but when it finds an escape to the surface of the body it is more
  - timaeus says: mild ; yet it disfigures the person by engendering scabs and
  - timaeus says: leprosies and kindred maladies. Sometimes it is mingled with
  - timaeus says: black bile and is shed upon the revolutions in the head, which
  - timaeus says: are the most divine, and confounds them ; and if this occurs
  - timaeus says: during sleep, the effects are milder, but if in the waking hours, it
  - timaeus says: is harder to relieve. This, as affecting the sacred part, is justly
  - timaeus says: called the sacred disease. Acid and saline phlegm is the source
  - timaeus says: of all diseases that take the form of catarrh - and these have
  - timaeus says: received manifold names according to the diverse places in
  - timaeus says: which the discharge takes place. Inflammations in various parts
  - timaeus says: of the body, so called from the heat and burning that occurs,
  - timaeus says: are all due to bile. When they have egress, they seethe up and
  - timaeus says: send forth all kinds of pustules ; but if they are suppressed
  - timaeus says: within, they cause many inflammatory diseases ; of which the
  - timaeus says: worst is when the inflammation entering into pure blood carries
  - timaeus says: away from its proper place the fibrine which was distributed
  - timaeus says: through the blood in order that it might preserve a due measure
  - timaeus says: of thinness and thickness and neither be so much liquefied by
  - timaeus says: heat as to flow out through the porous texture of the body, nor
  - timaeus says: become sluggish from excessive density and circulate with
  - timaeus says: difficulty in the veins. Now the fibrine by the nature of its
  - timaeus says: composition preserves the due mean in these respects. For if
  - timaeus says: from blood that is dead and beginning to cool the fibrine be
  - timaeus says: gathered apart, the rest of the blood is dissipated ; but if the
  - timaeus says: fibrine be allowed to remain, by the help of the cold air sur-
  - timaeus says: rounding, it quickly congeals it. The fibrine then in the blood
  - timaeus says: having this property, bile which is naturally formed of old blood
  - timaeus says: and is dissolved again into blood out of the flesh, enters warm
  - timaeus says: and liquid into the blood, at first gradually, and is condensed by
  - timaeus says: the power of the fibrine ; and as it is condensed and forced to
  - timaeus says: cool, it produces internal chill and shivering. But when a
  - timaeus says: greater quantity flows in, it subdues the fibrine with its heat,
  - timaeus says: and boiling up scatters it abroad ; and if it is able to obtain the
  - timaeus says: mastery to the end, it penetrates to the substance of the marrow,
  - timaeus says: and consuming it looses from thence the bonds of the soul, as it
  - timaeus says: were the moorings of a ship, and sets her free. But when the
  - timaeus says: bile is too feeble for this, and the body holds out against the
  - timaeus says: dissolution, itself is vanquished, and either is expelled by an
  - timaeus says: eruption over the whole body, or is driven through the veins
  - timaeus says: into the lower or upper belly, like an exile banished from a city
  - timaeus says: that has been at civil war ; and as it issues forth from the body,
  - timaeus says: it causes diarrhoea and dysentery and all diseases of that kind.
  - timaeus says: When a body has been stricken with sickness chiefly through
  - timaeus says: excess of fire, it exhibits continued inflammations and fevers
  - timaeus says: excess of air causes quotidian fevers ; excess of water tertian,
  - timaeus says: because it is more sluggish than air or fire ; excess of earth,
  - timaeus says: which is by four measures most sluggish of all, being purged
  - timaeus says: in a fourfold period of time, gives rise to quartan fevers, and is
  - timaeus says: with difficulty banished.

  - timaeus says: feels from time to time many a sore pang and many a delight
  - timaeus says: amid his passions and their fruits ; and he becomes mad for the
  - timaeus says: greater part of his life owing to the intensity of pleasures and
  - timaeus says: pains, keeping his soul in a state of disease and derangement
  - timaeus says: through the power of the body ; he is not however regarded as
  - timaeus says: sick, but as willingly vicious. But the truth is that incontinence
  - timaeus says: in sensual pleasures is a disease of the soul for the most part
  - timaeus says: arising from the fluid and moist condition of one element in
  - timaeus says: the body owing to porousness of the bones. So it is too with
  - timaeus says: nearly all intemperance in pleasure ; and the reproach attaching
  - timaeus says: thereto, as if men were willingly vicious, is incorrectly brought
  - timaeus says: against them. For no one is willingly wicked ; but it is owing
  - timaeus says: to some bad habit of body and unenlightened training that the
  - timaeus says: wicked man becomes wicked ; and these are always unwelcome
  - timaeus says: and imposed against his will. And where pains are concerned,
  - timaeus says: the soul likewise derives much evil from the body. For where
  - timaeus says: the humours of acid and salt phlegms and those that are bitter
  - timaeus says: and bilious roam about the body and find no outlet to the sur-
  - timaeus says: face, but being pent up within and blending their own exhala-
  - timaeus says: tions with the movement of the soul are mingled therewith, they
  - timaeus says: induce all kinds of mental diseases, more or less violent and
  - timaeus says: serious - and rushing to the three regions of the soul, in the part
  - timaeus says: which each attacks they multiply manifold forms of moroseness
  - timaeus says: and melancholy, of rashness and timidity, of forgetfulness and
  - timaeus says: dulness. And when, besides these vicious conditions, there are
  - timaeus says: added bad governments and bad principles maintained in public
  - timaeus says: and private speech ; when moreover no studies to be an antidote
  - timaeus says: are pursued from youth up, then it is that all of us who are
  - timaeus says: wicked become so, owing to two causes entirely beyond our own
  - timaeus says: control. The blame must lie rather with those who train than
  - timaeus says: with those who are trained, with the educators than the educa-
  - timaeus says: ted - however we must use our utmost zeal by education, pur-
  - timaeus says: suits, and studies to shun vice and embrace virtue. This subject
  - timaeus says: however belongs to a different branch of inquiry.

  - timaeus says: The counterpart to what has been said, the treatment
  - timaeus says: of body and mind and the principles by which they are pre-
  - timaeus says: served, were the proper and fitting complement of our dis-
  - timaeus says: course - for it is more just to dwell upon good than upon evil.
  - timaeus says: All that is good is fair, and what is fair is not disproportionate.
  - timaeus says: Accordingly an animal that is to be fair must, we affirm, be
  - timaeus says: well-proportioned. Now the smaller proportions we discern and
  - timaeus says: reason upon them ; but of the greatest and most momentous we
  - timaeus says: take no account. For in view of health and sickness and virtue
  - timaeus says: and vice no proportion or disproportion is more important than
  - timaeus says: that existing between body and soul themselves - yet we pay no
  - timaeus says: heed to these, nor do we reflect that if a feebler and smaller
  - timaeus says: frame be the vehicle of a soul that is strong and mighty in all
  - timaeus says: respects; or if the relation between the two be reversed, then
  - timaeus says: the entire creature is not fair ; for it is defective in the most
  - timaeus says: essential proportions. But the opposite condition is to him who
  - timaeus says: can discern it of all sights the fairest and loveliest. For ex-
  - timaeus says: ample, a body which possesses legs of excessive length or which
  - timaeus says: is unsymmetrical owing to any other disproportion, is not only
  - timaeus says: ugly, but in taking its share of labour brings infinite distress
  - timaeus says: on itself, suffering frequent fatigue and spasms, and often falling
  - timaeus says: in consequence of inability to control its motions- the same
  - timaeus says: then we must suppose to hold good of the combination of soul
  - timaeus says: and body which we call an animal ; when the soul in it is more
  - timaeus says: powerful than the body and of ardent temperament, she agitates it
  - timaeus says: and fills it from within with sickness; and when she impetuously
  - timaeus says: pursues some study or research, she wastes the body away -
  - timaeus says: and in giving instruction and conducting discussions private or
  - show timaeus: AT CENTER
  - show timaeus: talk AT CENTER
  - timaeus says: public in a spirit of contention and rivalry, she inflames and
  - timaeus says: weakens its fabric and brings on chills ; and thus deceiving most
  - timaeus says: of the so-called physicians induces them to assign causes for the
  - timaeus says: malady which are really in no way concerned with it. When on
  - timaeus says: the other hand a large body, too great for the soul, is joined
  - timaeus says: with a small and feeble mind, two kinds of appetites being
  - timaeus says: natural to mankind, on account of the body a craving for nourish-
  - timaeus says: ment and on account of the divinest part of us for knowledge
  - timaeus says: the motions of the stronger prevail and strengthen their faculty,
  - timaeus says: but that of the soul they render dull and slow of learning and of
  - timaeus says: recollection, and so produce stupidity, the most grievous of
  - timaeus says: maladies. There is but one safeguard against both these mis-
  - timaeus says: fortunes - neither should the soul be exercised without the body
  - timaeus says: nor the body without the soul, in order that they may be a
  - timaeus says: match for each other and attain balance and health. So the
  - timaeus says: mathematician, or whosoever is intensely absorbed in any intel-
  - timaeus says: lectual study, must allow corresponding exercise to his body,
  - timaeus says: submitting to athletic training ; while he who is careful in forming
  - timaeus says: his body must in turn give due exercise to his soul, calling in
  - timaeus says: the aid of art and of all philosophy, if he is justly to be called
  - timaeus says: at once fair and in the true sense good. The same treatment
  - timaeus says: too should be applied to the separate parts, in imitation of the
  - timaeus says: fashion of the All. For as the body is inflamed and cooled
  - timaeus says: within by the particles that enter, and again is dried and
  - timaeus says: moistened by those that are outside, and by the agency of these
  - timaeus says: two forces suffers all that ensues upon these conditions, if we
  - timaeus says: submit the body passively to the forces aforesaid, it is overcome
  - timaeus says: and destroyed - but if we imitate what we have called the fostress
  - timaeus says: and nurse of the All, and allow the body, if possible, never to be
  - timaeus says: inactive, but keep it astir and, exciting continual vibrations in it,
  - timaeus says: furnish it with the natural defence against the motions from
  - timaeus says: without and within ; and by moderately exercising it bring into
  - timaeus says: orderly relation with each other according to their affinities
  - timaeus says: the affections and particles that are going astray in the body ;
  - timaeus says: then, as we have already described in speaking of the universe,
  - timaeus says: we shall not suffer mutually hostile particles to be side by side
  - timaeus says: and to engender discord and disease in the body, but we shall
  - timaeus says: set friend beside friend so as to bring about a healthy state.
  - timaeus says: Of all motions that which arises in any body by its own action
  - timaeus says: is the best (for it is most nearly allied to the motion of thought
  - timaeus says: and of the All), but that which is brought about by other
  - timaeus says: agency is inferior ; and the worst of all is that which, while the
  - timaeus says: body is lying still, is produced by other agents which move
  - timaeus says: it piecemeal. Accordingly of all modes of purifying and
  - timaeus says: restoring the body gymnastic is the best ; the next best is
  - timaeus says: any swinging motion such as of sailing or any other con-
  - timaeus says: veyance of the body which does not tire it- a third kind is
  - timaeus says: useful sometimes under absolute necessity, but in no other cir-
  - timaeus says: cumstances should be employed by a judicious person, I mean
  - timaeus says: medical purgation effected by drugs. No disease, not in-
  - timaeus says: volving imminent danger, should be irritated by drugs. For
  - timaeus says: every form of sickness has a certain correspondence to the
  - timaeus says: nature of living creatures. Their constitution is so ordered as
  - timaeus says: to have definite periods of life both for the kind and for the
  - timaeus says: individual, which has its own fixed span of existence, always
  - timaeus says: excepting inevitable accidents. For the triangles of each
  - timaeus says: creature are composed at the very outset with the capacity of
  - timaeus says: holding out for a certain definite time ; beyond which its life
  - timaeus says: cannot be prolonged. The same applies also to the constitution
  - timaeus says: of diseases ; if these are interfered with by medicine to the dis-
  - timaeus says: regard of their appointed period, it often happens that a few
  - timaeus says: slight maladies are rendered numerous and grave. Wherefore
  - timaeus says: we should guide all such sicknesses by careful living, so far as
  - timaeus says: we have time to attend to it, and not provoke a troublesome
  - timaeus says: mischief by medical treatment.

  - timaeus says: Now so far as concerns the animate creature and
  - timaeus says: the bodily part of it, how a man, guiding the latter and by him-
  - timaeus says: self being guided, should live a most rational life, let this dis-
  - timaeus says: cussion suffice. But the part which is to guide the body must
  - timaeus says: beforehand be trained with still greater care to be most perfect
  - timaeus says: and efficient for education. To deal with this subject minutely
  - timaeus says: would in itself be a sufficient task - but if we may merely touch
  - timaeus says: upon it in conformity with our previous discourse, we should
  - timaeus says: find a consistent answer to the question from the following
  - timaeus says: reflections. As we have often said, three forms .of soul with
  - timaeus says: threefold functions are implanted in us, and each of these has its
  - timaeus says: proper motions. Accordingly we may say as briefly as possible
  - timaeus says: that whichever of these continues in idleness and keeps its own
  - timaeus says: motions inactive, this must needs become the weakest ; but that
  - timaeus says: which is in constant exercise waxes strongest - wherefore we
  - timaeus says: must see that they exercise their motions in due proportion.
  - timaeus says: As to the supreme form of soul that is within us, we must
  - timaeus says: believe that God has given it to each of us as a guiding genius
  - timaeus says: even that which we say, and say truly, dwells in the summit of
  - timaeus says: our body and raises us from earth towards our celestial affinity,
  - timaeus says: seeing we are of no earthly, but of heavenly growth - since to
  - timaeus says: heaven, whence in the beginning was the birth of our soul, the
  - timaeus says: diviner part attaches the head or root of us and makes our whole
  - timaeus says: body upright. Now whoso is busied with appetites or ambitions
  - timaeus says: and labours hard after these, all the thoughts of his heart must
  - timaeus says: be altogether mortal ; and so far as it is possible for him to be-
  - timaeus says: come utterly mortal, he falls no whit short of this ; for this is
  - timaeus says: what he has been fostering. But he whose heart has been set
  - timaeus says: on the love of learning and on true wisdom, and has chiefly
  - timaeus says: exercised this part of himself, this man must without fail have
  - timaeus says: thoughts that are immortal and divine, if he lay hold upon
  - timaeus says: the truth ; and so far as it lies in human nature to possess im-
  - timaeus says: mortality, he lacks nothing thereof; and seeing that he ever
  - timaeus says: cherishes the divinest part and keeps in good estate the guardian
  - timaeus says: spirit that dwells in him, he must be happy above all. And the
  - timaeus says: care of this is always the same for every man, to wit that he
  - timaeus says: assign to every part its proper exercise and nourishment. To
  - timaeus says: the divine part of us are akin the thoughts and revolutions of
  - timaeus says: the All - these every man should follow, restoring the revolu-
  - timaeus says: tions in the head, that are marred through our earthly birth, by
  - timaeus says: learning to know the harmonies and revolutions of the All, so as
  - timaeus says: to render the thinking soul like the object of its thought ac-
  - timaeus says: cording to her primal nature - and when he has made it like, so
  - timaeus says: shall he have the fulfilment of that most excellent life that was
  - timaeus says: set by the gods before mankind for time present and time to
  - timaeus says: come.

  - timaeus says: Thus then the task laid upon us at the begin-
  - timaeus says: ning, to set forth the nature of the universe down to the gene-
  - timaeus says: ration of man, seems wellnigh to have reached its fulfilment.
  - timaeus says: For the manner of the generation of other animals we may deal
  - timaeus says: with in brief, so there be no need to speak at length - thus shall
  - timaeus says: we in our own eyes preserve due measure in our account of
  - timaeus says: them. Let us then state it in this way. Of those who were
  - timaeus says: born as men, such as were cowardly and spent their life in
  - timaeus says: unrighteousness, were, according to the probable account, trans-
  - timaeus says: formed into women at the second incarnation. At that time
  - timaeus says: the gods for these reasons invented the love of sexual inter-
  - timaeus says: course, in that they created one kind of animate nature in men
  - timaeus says: and another in women, which two they formed in the following
  - timaeus says: way. To the channel of the drink, where it receives the fluid
  - timaeus says: passing down through the lungs beneath the kidneys into the
  - timaeus says: bladder and sends it forth by pressure of the air, they opened a
  - timaeus says: passage into the column of marrow which runs from the head
  - timaeus says: down the neck and along the spine, and which we have already
  - timaeus says: termed the seed. This, being quick with soul and finding an
  - timaeus says: outlet, gave to the part where it found the outlet a lively desire
  - timaeus says: of egress and produced a longing to generate. Wherefore the
  - timaeus says: nature of the generative part in man is disobedient and head-
  - timaeus says: strong, like a creature that will not listen to reason, and en-
  - timaeus says: deavours to have all its will because of its frantic passions ; and
  - timaeus says: again for the same reason what is called the matrix and womb
  - timaeus says: in women, which is in them a living nature appetent of child-
  - timaeus says: bearing, when it is a long time fruitless beyond the due season,
  - timaeus says: is distressed and sorely disturbed, and straying about in the
  - timaeus says: body and cutting off the passages of the breath it impedes
  - timaeus says: respiration and brings the sufferer into the extremest anguish
  - timaeus says: and provokes all manner of diseases besides ; until the passion
  - timaeus says: and love of both unite them, and, as it were plucking fruit from
  - timaeus says: a tree, sow in the womb, as if in a field, living things invisible
  - timaeus says: for smallness and unformed, and again separating them nourish
  - timaeus says: them within till they grow large, and finally bringing them to
  - timaeus says: light complete the birth of a living creature. Such is the nature
  - timaeus says: of women and all that is female. The tribe of birds was trans-
  - timaeus says: formed, by growing feathers instead of hair, from men that were
  - timaeus says: harmless but light-minded ; who were students of the heavenly
  - timaeus says: bodies, but fancied in their simpleness that the demonstrations
  - timaeus says: were most sure concerning them which they obtained through
  - timaeus says: the sight. And the race of brutes that walk on dry land comes
  - timaeus says: from those who sought not the aid of philosophy at all nor
  - timaeus says: inquired into the nature of the universe, because they used no
  - timaeus says: longer the revolutions in the head, but followed as their guides
  - timaeus says: the parts of the soul that are in the breast. From these practices
  - timaeus says: their front limbs and their heads were by their natural affinity
  - timaeus says: drawn towards the ground and there supported ; and their heads
  - timaeus says: were lengthened out and took all sorts of forms, just as the orbits
  - timaeus says: in each were crushed out of shape through disuse. For the same
  - timaeus says: reason such races were made four-footed and many-footed ; for
  - timaeus says: God gave many props to the more senseless creatures, that
  - timaeus says: they might the more be drawn earthward. As to the most
  - timaeus says: senseless of all, whose whole bodies were altogether stretched
  - timaeus says: at length on the earth, seeing they had no longer any need
  - timaeus says: of feet, God made them footless to crawl upon the ground. And
  - timaeus says: the fourth class that lives in the water was formed of the most
  - timaeus says: utterly foolish and senseless of all, whom they that transfigured
  - timaeus says: them thought not worthy even of pure respiration, because their
  - timaeus says: soul was polluted with all manner of iniquity ; but in place of
  - timaeus says: inhaling the fine pure element of air they were thrust into the
  - timaeus says: turbid and lowly respiration of water. Hence is the tribe of
  - timaeus says: fishes and of all shell-fish that live in the water ; which have the
  - timaeus says: uttermost dwelling-place in penalty for the uttermost folly. In
  - timaeus says: such manner then and now all creatures change places one with
  - timaeus says: another, rising or falling with the loss or gain of understanding
  - timaeus says: or of folly.
