  - socrates says: And in assigning on natural principles but one
  - socrates says: single pursuit or craft which was suited to each citizen severally,
  - socrates says: we declared that those whose duty it was to fight on behalf of
  - socrates says: the community must be guardians only of the city, in case any
  - socrates says: one whether without or within her walls should seek to injure
  - socrates says: her, and that they should give judgment mercifully to their

  - socrates says: And those who had undergone this discipline, we
  - socrates says: said, must not consider that they have any private property in
  - socrates says: gold or silver or anything else whatsoever, but as auxiliaries
  - socrates says: drawing from those whom they preserved so much pay in return
  - socrates says: for their protection as was sufficient for temperate men, they
  - socrates says: were to spend it in common and pass their lives in company
  - socrates says: with one another, devoting themselves perpetually to the pursuit
  - socrates says: of virtue and relieved from all other occupations.

  - socrates says: Moreover with regard to women we observed that
  - socrates says: their natures must be brought into harmonious similarity with

  - socrates says: And what were our rules concerning the pro-
  - socrates says: creation of children ? This, I think, is easy of recollection
  - socrates says: because of the novelty of our scheme. We ordained that the
  - socrates says: rights of marriage and of children should be common to all, to
  - socrates says: the end that no one should ever know his own offspring, but
  - socrates says: that each should look upon all as his kindred, regarding as
  - socrates says: sisters and brethren all such as were between suitable limits of
  - socrates says: age, and those of the former and previous generations as parents
  - socrates says: and grandparents, and those after them as children and children's

  - socrates says: Next with a view to securing immediately the
  - socrates says: utmost possible perfection in their natures, do we not remember
  - socrates says: that it was incumbent on the rulers of both sexes to make
  - socrates says: provision for the contraction of marriages by some secret mode
  - socrates says: of allotment, that to the good and bad separately might be
  - socrates says: allotted mates of their own kind, and so no ill-feeling should

  - socrates says: And the offspring of the good we said must be
  - socrates says: reared, while that of the bad was to be secretly dispersed among
  - socrates says: the other classes of the state ; and continually observing them
  - socrates says: as they grew up, the rulers were to restore to their rank such as

  - socrates says: Listen then and I will tell you in the next
  - socrates says: place what I feel about the constitution which we described.
  - socrates says: My feeling is something like this, suppose a man, on beholding
  - socrates says: beautiful creatures, whether the work of the painter or really
  - socrates says: alive but at rest, should conceive a desire to see them in motion
  - socrates says: and putting into active exercise the qualities which seemed to
  - socrates says: belong to their form this is just what I feel about our city
  - socrates says: which we described - I would fain listen to one who depicted
  - socrates says: her engaged in a becoming manner with other countries in those
  - socrates says: struggles which cities must undergo, and going to war, and
  - socrates says: when at war showing a result worthy of her training and educa-
  - socrates says: tion, both when dealing in action and parleying in speech with
  - socrates says: other cities. Now, Critias and Hermocrates, my own verdict
  - socrates says: upon myself is that I should never be capable of celebrating the
  - socrates says: city and her people according to their merit. So far as concerns
  - socrates says: me indeed, that is no marvel ; but I have formed the same
  - socrates says: opinion about the poets, both past and present ; not that I
  - socrates says: disparage the poetic race, but any one can see that the imitative
  - socrates says: tribe will most easily and perfectly imitate the surroundings
  - socrates says: amid which they have been brought up, but that which lies
  - socrates says: outside the range of each man's experience is hard to imitate
  - socrates says: correctly in actions and yet harder in words. As to the class of
  - socrates says: sophists on the other hand, I have always held them to be well
  - socrates says: furnished with many fine discourses on other subjects ; yet I am
  - socrates says: afraid, seeing they wander from city to city and have never had
  - socrates says: dwellings of their own to manage, they may somehow fall short
  - socrates says: in their conception of philosophers and statesmen, as to what in
  - socrates says: time of war and battles they would do and say in their dealings
  - socrates says: and converse with divers people. One class then remains, those
  - socrates says: who share your habit of mind, having by nature and training a
  - socrates says: capacity for both philosophy and statecraft. Timaeus for in-
  - socrates says: stance, belonging to an admirably governed state, the Italian
  - socrates says: Lokris, and one of the foremost of its citizens in wealth and
  - socrates says: birth, has filled offices of the highest authority and honour in
  - socrates says: his native city, and has also in my judgment climbed to the
  - socrates says: topmost peak of all philosophy -- while at Athens we all know
  - socrates says: that Critias is no novice in any of the questions we are discuss-
  - socrates says: ing -- of Hermocrates too we must believe on the evidence of
  - socrates says: many witnesses that his genius and acquirements qualify him to
  - socrates says: deal with all such matters. This was in my mind yesterday
  - socrates says: when I willingly complied with your request that I should
  - socrates says: repeat the conversation concerning the ideal polity ; for I knew
  - socrates says: that no men were more competent than you, if you were willing,
  - socrates says: to supply the sequel -- no one else indeed at the present day
  - socrates says: could, after engaging our city in an honourable war, render her
  - socrates says: conduct worthy of her in all respects. So after saying all that
  - socrates says: was enjoined on me I in my turn enjoined upon you the task of
  - socrates says: which I now remind you. Accordingly you consulted together
  - socrates says: and agreed to entertain me at this time with a return ' feast of
  - socrates says: reason '. I am here then ready for it in festal array, and never
  - socrates says: was there a more eager guest.

  - hermocrates says: Indeed, Socrates, as Timaeus said, there will

  - hermocrates says: diately on leaving this spot, when we reached the guest-chamber
  - hermocrates says: at the house of Critias where we are staying, and even before
  - hermocrates says: that on our way thither, we were discussing this very matter.
  - hermocrates says: Critias then told us a story from an old tradition, which you had
  - hermocrates says: better repeat now, Critias, to Socrates, that he may help us to

  - critias says: Listen then, Socrates, to a tale which, strange
  - critias says: though it be, is yet perfectly true, as Solon, the wisest of the
  - critias says: seven, once affirmed. He was a relation and dear friend of
  - critias says: Dropides, my great-grandfather, as he says himself in man
  - critias says: passages of his poems - and Dropides told my grandfather
  - critias says: Critias, who when advanced in life repeated it to us, that there
  - critias says: were great and marvellous exploits achieved by Athens in days
  - critias says: of old, which through lapse of time and the perishing of men
  - critias says: have vanished from memory - and the greatest of all is one
  - critias says: which it were fitting for us to narrate, and so at once discharge
  - critias says: our debt of gratitude to you and worthily and truly extol
  - critias says: the goddess in this her festival by a kind of hymn in her
  - critias says: honour.
  - socrates says: A good proposal. But what was this deed which
  - socrates says: Critias described on the authority of Solon as actually performed
  - socrates says: of old by this city, though unrecorded in history?

  - critias says: I will tell an ancient story that I heard from
  - critias says: a man no longer young. For Critias was then, as he said, hard
  - critias says: upon ninety years of age, while I was about ten. It happened
  - critias says: to be the 'children's day' of the Apaturia ; and then as usual
  - critias says: the boys enjoyed their customary pastime, our fathers giving us
  - critias says: prizes for reciting poetry. A great deal of poetry by various
  - critias says: authors was recited, and since that of Solon was new at the
  - critias says: time, many of us children sang his poems. So one of the clans-
  - critias says: men said, whether he really thought so or whether he wished to
  - critias says: please Critias, he considered that Solon was not only in other
  - critias says: respects the wisest of mankind but also the noblest of all poets
  - critias says: The old man how well I recollect it was extremely pleased
  - critias says: and said smiling, Yes, Amynandros, if he had not treated poetry
  - critias says: merely as a by-work, but had made a serious business of it like
  - critias says: the rest, and if he had finished the legend which he brought
  - critias says: hither from Egypt, instead of being compelled to abandon it by
  - critias says: the factions and other troubles which he found here on his
  - critias says: return, my belief is that neither Hesiod nor Homer nor any
  - critias says: other poet would have enjoyed greater fame than he. What
  - critias says: was the legend, Critias ? asked Amynandros. It concerned a
  - critias says: mighty achievement, he replied, and one that deserved to be the
  - critias says: most famous in the world ; a deed which our city actually per-
  - critias says: formed, but owing to time and the destruction of the doers
  - critias says: thereof the story has not lasted to our times. Tell us from the
  - critias says: beginning, said the other, what was the tale that Solon told, and
  - critias says: how and from whom he heard it as true.
  - critias says: There is in Egypt, said Critias, in the Delta, at the apex of
  - critias says: which the stream of the Nile divides, a province called the
  - critias says: Saitic ; and the chief city of this province is Sais, the birthplace
  - critias says: of Amasis the king. The founder of their city is a goddess,
  - critias says: whose name in the Egyptian tongue is Neith, and in Greek, as
  - critias says: they aver, Athena - the people are great lovers of the Athenians
  - critias says: and claim a certain kinship with our countrymen. Now when
  - critias says: Solon travelled to this city he said he was most honourably
  - critias says: entreated by the citizens; moreover when he questioned con-
  - critias says: cerning ancient things such of the priests as were most versed
  - critias says: therein, he found that neither he nor any other Grecian man,
  - critias says: one might wellnigh say, knew aught about such matters. And
  - critias says: once, when he wished to lead them on to talk of ancient times,
  - critias says: he essayed to tell them of the oldest legends of Hellas, of
  - critias says: Phoroneus who was called the first man, and of Niobe; and
  - critias says: again he told the tale of Deukalion and Pyrrha, how they sur-
  - critias says: vived after the deluge, and he reckoned up their descendants, and
  - critias says: tried, by calculating the periods, to count up the number of
  - critias says: years that passed during the events he related. Then said one
  - critias says: of the priests, a man well stricken in years, O Solon, Solon, ye
  - critias says: Greeks are ever children, and old man that is a Grecian is there
  - critias says: none. And when Solon heard it, he said, What meanest thou
  - critias says: by this ? And the priest said, Ye are all young in your souls ;
  - critias says: for ye have not in them because of old tradition any ancient
  - critias says: belief nor knowledge that is hoary with eld. And the reason of
  - critias says: it is this - many and manifold are the destructions of mankind
  - critias says: that have been and shall be; the greatest are by fire and by
  - critias says: water; but besides these there are lesser ones in countless other
  - critias says: fashions. For indeed that tale that is also told among you, how
  - critias says: that Phaethon, the child of the Sun, yoked his father's chariot,
  - critias says: and for that he could not drive in his father's path, he burnt up
  - critias says: all things upon earth and himself was smitten by a thunderbolt
  - critias says: and slain this story, as it is told, has the fashion of a fable;
  - critias says: but the truth of it is a deviation of the bodies that move round
  - critias says: the earth in the heavens, whereby comes at long intervals of
  - critias says: time a destruction with much fire of the things that are upon
  - critias says: earth. Thus do such as dwell on mountains and in high places
  - critias says: and in dry perish more widely than they who live beside rivers
  - critias says: and by the sea. Now the Nile, which is in all else our preserver,
  - critias says: saves us then also from this distress by releasing his founts - but
  - critias says: when the gods send a flood upon the earth, cleansing her with
  - critias says: waters, those in the mountains are saved, the neatherds and
  - critias says: shepherds, but the inhabitants of the cities in your land are
  - critias says: swept by the rivers into the sea. But in this country neither
  - critias says: then nor at any time does water fall from on high upon the
  - critias says: fields, but contrariwise all rises up by nature from below.
  - critias says: Wherefore and for which causes the legends preserved here are
  - critias says: the most ancient that are told - but the truth is that in all places,
  - critias says: where exceeding cold or heat does not forbid, there are ever
  - critias says: human beings, now more, now fewer. Now whether at Athens
  - critias says: or in Egypt, or in any other place whereof we have tidings, any-
  - critias says: thing noble or great or otherwise notable has occurred, we have
  - critias says: all written down and preserved from ancient times in our temple
  - critias says: here. But with you and other nations the commonwealth has
  - critias says: only just been enriched with letters and all else that cities
  - critias says: require - and again after the wonted term of years like a recur-
  - critias says: ring sickness comes rushing on them the torrent from heaven ;
  - critias says: and it leaves only the unlettered and untaught among you, so
  - critias says: that as it were ye become young again with a new birth, know-
  - critias says: ing nought of what happened in the ancient times either in our
  - critias says: country or in yours. For instance the genealogies, Solon, which
  - critias says: you just now recounted, concerning the people of your country,
  - critias says: are little better than children's tales. For in the first place ye
  - critias says: remember but one deluge, whereas there had been many before
  - critias says: it ; and moreover ye know not that the fairest and noblest race
  - critias says: among mankind lived once in your country, whence ye sprang
  - critias says: and all your city which now is, from a very little seed that of
  - critias says: old was left over. Ye however know it not, because the sur-
  - critias says: vivors lived and died for many generations without utterance in
  - critias says: writing. For once upon a time, Solon, far back beyond the
  - critias says: greatest destruction by waters, that which is now the city of
  - critias says: the Athenians was foremost both in war and in all besides, and
  - critias says: her laws were exceedingly righteous above all cities. Her deeds
  - critias says: and her government are said to have been the noblest among all
  - critias says: under heaven whereof the report has come to our ears. And
  - critias says: Solon said that on hearing this he was astonished, and used all
  - critias says: urgency in entreating the priests to relate to him from beginning
  - critias says: to end all about those ancient citizens. So the priest said, I
  - critias says: grudge thee not, O Solon, and I will tell it for thy sake and for
  - critias says: the sake of thy city, and chiefly for the honour of the goddess
  - critias says: who was the possessor and nurse and instructress both of your
  - critias says: city and of ours ; for she founded yours earlier by a thousand
  - critias says: years, having taken the seed of you from Earth and Hephaistos;
  - critias says: and ours in later time. And the date of our city's foundation is
  - critias says: recorded in our sacred writings to be eight thousand years ago.
  - critias says: But concerning the citizens of Athens nine thousand years ago I
  - critias says: will inform you in brief of their laws and of the noblest of the
  - critias says: deeds which they performed - the exact truth concerning every-
  - critias says: thing we will examine in due order hereafter, taking the actual
  - critias says: records at our leisure.
  - critias says: Consider now their laws in comparison with those of our
  - critias says: country ; for you will find here at the present day many exam-
  - critias says: ples of the laws which then existed among you - first the
  - critias says: separation of the priestly caste from the rest ; next the distinc-
  - critias says: tion of the craftsmen, that each kind plies its own craft by itself
  - critias says: and mingles not with another ; and the class of shepherds and
  - critias says: of hunters and of husbandmen are set apart ; and that of the
  - critias says: warriors too you have surely noticed is here sundered from all
  - critias says: the other classes ; for on them the law enjoins to study the art
  - critias says: of war and nought else. Furthermore there is the fashion of
  - critias says: their arming with spears and shields, wherewith we have been
  - critias says: the first men in Asia to arm ourselves ; for the goddess taught
  - critias says: this to us, as she did first to you in that country of yours.
  - critias says: Again as regards knowledge, you see how careful our law is in
  - critias says: its. first principles, investigating the laws of nature till it arrives
  - critias says: at divination and medicine, the object of which is health, draw-
  - critias says: ing from these divine studies lessons useful for human needs,
  - critias says: and adding to these all the sciences that are connected there-
  - critias says: withal. With all this constitution and order the goddess estab-
  - critias says: lished you when she founded your nation first; choosing out
  - critias says: the spot in which ye were born because she saw that the mild
  - critias says: temperament of its seasons would produce the highest intelli-
  - critias says: gence in its people. Seeing then that the goddess was a lover
  - critias says: of war and of wisdom, she selected the spot that should bring
  - critias says: forth men likest to herself, and therein she first founded your
  - critias says: race. Thus then did ye dwell governed by such laws as I have
  - critias says: described, ay and even better still, surpassing all men in ex-
  - critias says: cellence, as was meet for them that were offspring and nurslings
  - critias says: of gods.
  - critias says:  Many and mighty are the deeds of your city recorded here
  - critias says: for the marvel of men ; but one is there which for greatness and
  - critias says: nobleness surpasses all the rest. For our chronicles tell what a
  - critias says: power your city quelled of old, that marched in wanton inso-
  - critias says: lence upon all Europe and Asia together, issuing yonder from
  - critias says: the Atlantic ocean. For in those days the sea there could be
  - critias says: crossed, since it had an island before the mouth of the strait
  - critias says: is called, as ye say, the pillars of Herakles. Now this
  - critias says: island was greater than Libya and Asia together ; and there-
  - critias says: from there was passage for the sea-farers of those times to the
  - critias says: islands, and from the islands to all the opposite continent
  - critias says: bounds that ocean truly named. For these regions that
  - critias says: lie within the strait aforesaid seem to be but a bay having a
  - critias says: narrow entrance ; but the other is ocean verily, and the land
  - critias says: surrounding it may with fullest truth and fitness be named a
  - critias says: continent. In this island Atlantis arose a great and marvellous
  - critias says: might of kings, ruling over all the island itself, and many other
  - critias says: islands, and parts of the mainland; and besides these, of the
